## Headphones I own

### Audio Technica ATH-M50x

My first "nice headphone", which I purchased around 2014! Before it, I used some random gaming headset that eventually broke. These were my daily driver for EVERYTHING from around 2014 to December 2025, replaced by my Sennheiser HD620S. It is unlikely that I will continue using them on a daily-driver basis, but I will continue to care for them, I'll keep them around as a sound quality reference, and its history with me earns it a permanent place in my collection.

It's hard for me to give it a good judgement because I switched the earpads to something very durable and washable, but it probably alters the sound for the worst. As I have it, the sound feels very thin/tinny.

### Sennheiser HD 620S

These are the second "nice headphone" I've ever owned, purchased during 2025 black Friday. They've become my daily-driver and I've been led to believe that it's quite neutral, so it's my reference point.

### Sennheiser HD 800S

I just ordered these, but it's on backorder so it'll be a while until I can spend a lot of time with it.

From what I've tried in the store, these feel incredibly open and natural-sounding. I'm not famliliar with audiophile terminology, but I've been told these have incredible soundstage, and it really does feel like the sound exists in a much wider space than I've ever experienced before in a headphone. Classical music is absolutely incredible on these.

It lacks bass though, so rock and metal music can feel a bit hollow. I'm hoping to try out EQ'ing them to see how good it can get.

I can't wait to get my copy!

## Other headphones I've tried

### Audeze MM-500

(I don't remember what these were like. I'll need to try them again.)

### Audio Technica ATH-R50x

Sounds too thin/tinny to me. I didn't like this one.

### FiiO FT13

Too bassy and muddy-sounding for me. They're still nice, but I definitely prefer my HD 620S.

### Meze 105 Silva

(I don't remember what these were like. I'll need to try them again.)

### Sennheiser HD 550

To my ears, they're HD 620S, but open-sounding, and less bass. I really liked them!

I'd probably need to spend extra time with them to pick out more differences from the 620S.

I probably just really like Sennheiser's tuning.

### Sony MDR-MV1

Extremely bassy and muddy-sounding. I didn't like this one.
