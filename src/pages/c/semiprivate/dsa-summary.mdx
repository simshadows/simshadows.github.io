# THIS PAGE IS A VERY EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

*I'm not 100% sure yet how to write this summary. This page serves as a draft of what I might add to it.*

*For now, it's just a brainstorm of dotpoints. I'm having trouble writing it out though due to how much variety and intuition is involved. After I figure out what content I want to include, I want to try to flesh it out to include more detail.*


## Array and Search Techniques (1D)

- Sliding Window
- Two-Pointer


## Trees

- Pre-Order Traversal
- In-Order Traversal
- Post-Order Traversal


## Graphs

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - A\* Algorithm


## Dynamic Programming

- TODO
