*I am using **Microsoft SQL Server** these days, so this cheatsheet will currently assume you're using it.*

*I will rework this cheatsheet to be more DBMS-agnostic later.*

## `SELECT` Statements

### Whole Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable;
```

### Common Clauses

```sql
SELECT
    MyCol1,
    MyCol2,
    MyCol3,
    SUM(MyCol4) AS MySum
FROM MyTable
GROUP BY
    MyCol2,
    MyCol3
WHERE 
    MyCol1 = '1969-04-01'
    AND MyCol2 in ('mystr1', 'mystr2')
    AND (
        MyCol3 <= 4
        OR MyCol3 BETWEEN 10 AND 20
    )
HAVING
    SUM(MyCol4) > 2
ORDER BY
    MyCol1 ASC,
    MyCol3 DESC
;
```

- `BETWEEN` is all inclusive.
- `ORDER BY` is `ASC` by default if you omit the `ASC`/`DESC`.
- **DISCLAIMER: I'm actually not 100% sure a query like this is entirely correct since I'm just building up a contrived example. I should test it somehow, and then remove this disclaimer when I'm confident it works.**

### Joins

(TODO)

### Unions
