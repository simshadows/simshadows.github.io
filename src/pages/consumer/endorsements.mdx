Given that I'm highly critical of businesses that screw over the customer and I have a list of my criticisms [here](/consumer/boycotts/), I figured that I should balance things out by calling out businesses that I find acceptable, and I'd like to especially call out any businesses that have gone above and beyond.

## Best Experiences

### B&H Photo Video

**[`https://www.bhphotovideo.com/`](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/)**

I accidentally bought a bunch of individual items for a high price, then realized a few days later that I should've bought an item bundle. The bundle is 2/3 the price of the price I paid for the individual items, and comes with extra stuff that I really should've bought as well. I expected that I'd ring up and they'd just say they can't do anything about it, and fair enough, this was my error. When I actually rang up B&H, **within 10 minutes of calling, I was given a refund of the price difference (which quickly showed up in my PayPal notifications), AND they arranged the extra items to be shipped to me.**

The customer service here is especially notable, given that they are a US-based retailer and I am based in Australia. With no Australian presence, they incur greater cost to service my request, all with _**probably**_ lower pressure to conform to consumer laws when dealing across borders.

I don't usually shop with overseas retailers if perfectly good local options in Australia exist (such as *[George's Cameras](https://www.georges.com.au/)*). I purchased from B&H because an item I wanted is not available in Australia. But given my experience with them, and given their prices actually seem quite competitive (though you'd need to factor in the customs charges), I will be considering B&H for photography or video-related purchases from now on.

## Others Worth Mentioning

### Amazon

**[`https://www.amazon.com/`](https://www.amazon.com/)**

**[`https://www.amazon.com.au/`](https://www.amazon.com.au/)**

This is a weird one because I'm soft-boycotting Amazon, while at the same time I've only ever had good experiences with them. They are ridiculously fast at delivering my packages, it's been great for little emergencies where I need something ASAP, their prices are often the lowest, and their customer service staff would probably sacrifice a newborn if it means a misfortune such as a dead-on-arrival or missing item is sorted out such that you're actually made better than if you didn't encounter the misfortune.

I just wish it didn't come at the cost of the workers' wellbeing (most notably the warehouse staff), [the smaller businesses that are exploited by Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r3x2t872Pc), and the fact that this is all making some top executives such as Jeff Bezos too comically rich. I suspect that Amazon's *continued existence* is a net negative to the greater economy (though I don't have evidence of that).

I will continue soft-boycotting Amazon even if they've never done me wrong as a consumer.

### George's Cameras

**[`https://www.georges.com.au/`](https://www.georges.com.au/)**

Although I've experienced one weird one-off problem with them which I've outlined [here](/consumer/boycotts/#boycotted-stores-and-online-businesses), George's Cameras has otherwise consistently delivered quality, and often at the best price.
