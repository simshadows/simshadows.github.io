All solutions on this page were written by me without reading any hints or solutions.

My solutions aren't necessarily great, but they did the job and got me the answers.

My suggestion to run these solutions:
```
$ cat input.txt | ./solution.py
```

Links to the full challenge specifications are included throughout this document. The original specifications aren't allowed to be reproduced, so I can't repost them here.
