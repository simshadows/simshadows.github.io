## Concert Tickets <Spec href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1091/" cdate="2024-01-18" />

I initially misunderstood the problem spec and thought that there was no time dimension to the problem, leading to two totally incorrect solutions:

import SolConcertTicketsFail01 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/concert-tickets--fail01.py?raw" //_
import SolConcertTicketsFail02 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/concert-tickets--fail02.py?raw" //_

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="Failed Solution 1">
    <Code code={SolConcertTicketsFail01} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="Failed Solution 2">
    <Code code={SolConcertTicketsFail02} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

The first logically correct solution I made was too slow due to <Latex code="O(n)" /> element deletions (even when I submitted it for `PyPy3`), leading to an overall time complexity is <Latex code="O(nm)" />. I would've liked to use a BST data structure like C++'s `std::multiset`, but Python lacks a standard library implementation.

import SolConcertTicketsFail03 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/concert-tickets--fail03-tle.py?raw" //_

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="TLE'd Python Solution">
    <Code code={SolConcertTicketsFail03} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

But at least I know the idea works, leading me to my first successful solution that passed all tests. I decided to rewrite in C++ since I wasn't having any luck in Python. This solution has time complexity <Latex code="O(m \log n)" /> due to <Latex code="O(\log n)" /> operations on `std::multiset`:

import SolConcertTickets from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/concert-tickets.cpp?raw" //_

<Code code={SolConcertTickets} lang="cpp" />


## Restaurant Customers <Spec href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/" cdate="2024-01-19" />

I initially attempted Python, but TLE'd with PyPy3:

import SolRestaurantCustomersFail01 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/restaurant-customers--fail01-tle.py?raw" //_

import SolRestaurantCustomersFail02 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/restaurant-customers--fail02-tle.py?raw" //_

import SolRestaurantCustomersFail03 from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/restaurant-customers--fail03-tle.py?raw" //_

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="TLE'd Python Solution 1">
    <Code code={SolRestaurantCustomersFail01} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="TLE'd Python Solution 2">
    <Code code={SolRestaurantCustomersFail02} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="TLE'd Python Solution 3">
    <Code code={SolRestaurantCustomersFail03} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

Switching over to C++ and reimplementing my first Python solution passed all tests:

import SolRestaurantCustomers from "./_solutions.sorting-and-searching/restaurant-customers.cpp?raw" //_

<Code code={SolRestaurantCustomers} lang="cpp" />
