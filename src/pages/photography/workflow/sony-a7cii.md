## Purpose of my A7CII

This body is my current use-for-everything everyday carry camera body. I love taking photos of everything at home, and I bring the camera with me every time I leave the house.

I intend on eventually buying a second interchangable camera body whenever the A7CR is updated. When that happens, the new body will likely be for home use and special purpose while my A7CII will be mostly used for bringing out of the house as my everyday carry camera.

## Configuration
