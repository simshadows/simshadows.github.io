TL;DR: it's a sound mixer.

Back in the day, we literally didn't have widely-available tech to mix the sound from the game and the sound from other sources like VoIP to talk to your teammates.

Halo tournaments back in the day consisted of players on individual monitor+speaker setups in a loud room with shouting fans while they attempted to physically communicate with their teammates next to them.

A prototype sound mixer allowed an underdog team to actually tune out the noise and focus, and it even allowed them to hear the spawning sounds, which gave them a huge advantage in the tournament.
