# THIS PAGE IS A VERY EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

_**I pretty much copied in some notes I wrote a long time ago, originally written in a visually-structured `.txt` format. I'm trying to port those notes to mdx. I plan on continuing learning Kubernetes and working on these notes to help consolidate my learning.**_


## Resources

- [**LinuxFoundationX LFS158x - Introduction to Kubernetes**](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+3T2020/home) *(These notes were written while going through this resource.)*


## Chapter 1. From Monolith to Microservices

- Running many modules on a single server can have dependency issues.
- But implementing microservices with one full virtual server per module to separate dependencies may be too heavy.
- (By module, do they mean like, a single "instance" of a module?)
- Application containers solve the problem by segregating things in a lightweight manner.


## Chapter 2. Container Orchestration

Ideally, we want a single controller/management unit (or "Container Orchestrators") rather than having to individually manage containers.

- container = portable isolated virtual environments. Containers don't run microservices directly; they run container images.
- microservice = a kind of lightweight application with specific dependencies and envirionmental requirements
- container image = an application bundled with its dependencies and environmental requirements to run on a container.

Container orchestrators group systems together to form clusters where containers' deployment and management is automated at scale while meeting requirements:
- Fault-tolerance
- On-demand scalability
- Optimal resource usage
- Auto-discovery to automatically discover and communicate with each other
- Accessibility from the outside world
- Seamless updates/rollbacks without any downtime.

Kubernetes is an orchestration tool.<br />
(Others include: Amazon ECS, Azure Service Fabric, and Docker Swarm.)


## Chapter 3. Kubernetes

(I don't really get what software-defined storage (SDS) is yet.)


## Chapter 4. Kubernetes Architecture

master node = provides running environment for control plane<br />
(TODO: idk what this means)

*[SEE LATER]* Pod

Must keep control plane running at all costs. Master node is replicated for resiliency.

Master node runs the following control plane components:

- Data Store (etcd)
    - Stores all cluster state data (as a distributed key-value store).
    - New data is written only by appending to it.
    - etcdctl
        - A CLI tool for backup/snapshot/restore.
        - (TODO: Only on a single etcd instance? More useful for learning, but not as useful in production?)
    - stacked topology
        - [for example] etcd is configured on master node
        - Notably, stacking etcd with with master node means etcd is replicated with master node, while external etcd must be separately replicated.
    - external topology
        - [for example] etcd is on an external host (TODO: what precisely does this mean?)
        - Useful topology for isolation from other control plane components.
- API Server (kube-apiserver)
        - Intercepts RESTful calls from users, operators and external agents, then validates and processes them.<br />
            During processing API Server reads and writes etcd.
        - API Server is the only master plane component that can talk to etcd.
        - Highly configurable and customizable.<br />
            Secondary API servers can be used. Primary API server can function as a proxy for secondary API servers.
- Scheduler (kube-scheduler)
        - Assigns new workload objects, such as pods, to nodes.<br />
            Reads from API server: Resource usage data from etcd, and the new workload object's requirements.<br />
            Makes a decision, then communicates it to the API server. API server itself delegates workload deployment to other control plane components.
        - Highly configurable and customizable.<br />
            Can have multiple schedulers. Object configuration data should include a name of a scheduler to be expected to use. (Otherwise, default scheduler is used.)<br />
            Scheduling can get very complex for multi-node clusters.
- Controller Managers
        - Runs controllers to regulate the state of the cluster. (TODO: what does it mean by "run controllers"?)<br />
            Controllers continuously compare cluster's desired state with current state.<br />
            Corrective action is taken if needed to achieve desired state.
        - kube-controller-manager
            - Runs controllers that act when nodes become unavailable.
            - (TODO: What does this mean?) "to ensure pod counts are as expected, to create endpoints, service accounts, and API access tokens."
        - cloud-controller-manager
            - Runs controllers "responsible for interacting with the underlying infrastructure of a cloud provider when nodes become unavailable, to manage storage volumes when provided by a cloud service, and to manage load balancing and routing."
            - (TODO: What does this mean?)

In addition, the master node runs:

- Container Runtime
- Node Agent
- Proxy

worker node = provides running environment for client applications.

Worker nodes have following components:

- Container Runtime
    - Kubernetes doesn't directly handle containers.<br />
        It needs a container runtime such as:
        - Docker
        - CRI-O
        - containerd
        - frakti

- Node Agent (kubelet)
    - An agent running on each node. Communicates with the control plane.
    - Receives pod definitions (primarily from the API server), and interacts with the container runtime through the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).<br />
        ```
            +--------+         +----------+         +-------------------+
            | kublet |  <--->  | CRI shim |  <--->  | Container Runtime |
            +--------+         +----------+         +-------------------+
        ```
    - CRI shims
        - Implements the CRI.
        - Sits between kublet and the container runtime to provide an abstraction layer.
    - The CRI implements two services:
        - ImageService: responsible for all image-related operations.
        - RuntimeService: responsible for all pod and container-related operations.
- Proxy (kube-proxy)
    - An agent running on each node. Responsible for dynamic updates and maintenance of all networking rules on the node.
    - Abstracts pod networking and forwards connection requests to pods (e.g. TCP, UDP, and SCTP).
- Addons
    - Implements functionality not yet built into Kubernetes.
    - Examples:
        - Cluster DNS to assign DNS records to Kubernetes objects and resources.
        - Dashboard web user interface for cluster management.
        - Cluster-level monitoring container metrics. (Saves them to a central data store.)
        - Cluster-level container logs. (Saves them to a central data store.)

(TODO: What's a "client user"?)

(TODO: Get back to "Networking Challenges" and subsequent slides later. I don't entirely understand them at the moment.)

- IP-per-Pod
    - Kubernetes assigns a unique IP address to each pod.
- CNI (Container Network Interface)
    - A set of specifications and libraries for plugins to configure the networking for containers.
    - Container runtime offloads IP assignment to CNI, which gets an IP address from a plugin before forwarding it back to the container runtime.
    - (TODO: idk what any of this really means.)
- Services
    - Enables external networking accessibility.
    - (TODO: "complex encapsulations of network routing rule definitions stored in iptables on cluster nodes and implemented by kube-proxy agents". What does this mean?)


## Chapters 5-7

*Relevant chapters:*

- *Chapter 5. Installing Kubernetes*
- *Chapter 6. Minikube - A Local Kubernetes Cluster*
- *Chapter 7. Accessing Minikube*

kubectl = CLI tool to manage cluster resources and applications.

Useful commands:

```
minikube start
minikube start --container-runtime cri-o
minikube status
minikube ssh
minikube dashboard
minikube stop

kubectl config view
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get namespaces

kubectl proxy
curl http://localhost:8001/
```

Authentication using bearer tokens:

```
TOKEN=$(kubectl describe secret -n kube-system $(kubectl get secrets -n kube-system | grep default | cut -f1 -d ' ') | grep -E '^token' | cut -f2 -d':' | tr -d '\t' | tr -d " ")
APISERVER=$(kubectl config view | grep https | cut -f 2- -d ":" | tr -d " ")

curl $APISERVER --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --insecure
```

You can also authenticate with client certificate, client key, and certificate authority.<br />
TODO: Figure out how this works.
    - STEP 1: Find client-certificate and client-key in `.kube/config`
    - STEP 2: Encode them.
    - STEP 3: Run command `curl $APISERVER --cert encoded-cert --key encoded-key --cacert encoded-ca`

Useful commands within minikube ssh:

```
sudo docker container ls
sudo runc list
```


Useful commands within minikube ssh:

```
sudo docker container ls
sudo runc list
```


Other interesting-but-contextual commands seen:

```
kubectl -n kube-system describe pod kube-scheduler-minikube | grep "Container ID"
```


## Chapter 8. Kubernetes Building Blocks

With each object, we declare our intent (the desired state of the object) in the `spec` section.<br />
Kubernetes manages the `status` section for objects, where it records the actual state of the object.<br />
At any given point in time, the Control Plane tries to match the object's actual state to the desired state.
    
### Labels

Key-value pairs to organize objects.<br />
Labels don't provide unique identification. (Objects can share the same set of labels.)

Controllers use label selectors to select a subset of objects.<br />
Kubernetes supports two types of selector:

- equality-based selector
    - `=`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`==`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`!=`
- set-based selector
    - `in`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`notin`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`exist`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`does not exist`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`!`

### Namespaces

Virtual subclusters.<br />
Names within a namespace are unique, but not across namespaces.

By default, Kubernetes creates the following namespaces:

- kube-system
    - Objects created by the system, mostly control plane objects.
- default
    - Objects and resources created by admins and developers.
- kube-public
    - Unsecured and readable by anyone. Used for exposing public/non-sensitive information about the cluster.
- kube-node-lease
    - Node lease objects used for node heartbeat data. (TODO: idk what this means)

### Objects

- Pod
    - It is the smallest and simplest object.<br />
        It is a unit of deployment in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of an app.
    - A pod is a collection of one or more containers which:
        - are scheduled together
            - It is also the smallest scheduling unit in Kubernetes. Starts/stops/rescheduled as a single unit of work.
        - share the same network namespace
            - All containers within share the Pod IP address (TODO: NAT?).
        - have access to the same volumes
    - Pods cannot self-heal.<br />
        They are always(?) used with controller objects which handle replication, fault-tolerance, etc.<br />
        Pod specification is attached to controller objects using pod template (`template`).
- ReplicationController
    - (NO LONGER A RECOMMENDED CONTROLLER)
- ReplicaSet
    - Maintains a specified number of replicas of a pod template by constantly checking desired vs. current pods.
    - ReplicaSet is limited in features, so it's generally used with Deployment.
- Deployment
    - Deployment creates a ReplicaSet, which then creates the replicas of a pod template.
    - Deployments can handle rolling updates.
        - When something is updated (e.g. updated container image), Deployment may create a new ReplicaSet. (TODO: or multiple?)<br />
            It transitions seamlessly to the new ReplicaSet.
        - Some updates trigger a new revision number, while others (like scaling and labelling) don't.
        - Once a rolling update is complete, Deployment will still show the old ReplicaSet (as scaled to 0).<br />
            This is for the rollback capability.

### TODO: controller objects?

## Chapter 9. Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control

- (TODO: Reread this and maybe take notes. Didn't really read in too much detail due to low-priority for now.)
- (TODO: I don't really understand the details of authorization yet. Bit too abstract atm for me atm without trying it out.)
- (TODO: Useful exercise on access control towards the end of Chapter 9. Also check out the video.)

## Interesting Tidbits

etcd is based on the Raft Consensus Algorithm ([link](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14)).
