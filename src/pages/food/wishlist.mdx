### Sydney, Australia

- **15cenchi** (Japanese, Cheesecake) - CBD, Darling Square
- **Angel's Filipino Barbeque** (Filipino, BBQ) - Blacktown
- **Azuki Bakery** (Japanese, Bread, Cake) - Newtown
- **Du Plessy Pralin & Otello Chocolates Patisserie** (Chocolates, Cakes) - West Pymble
- **Gami Chicken & Beer** (Korean, Fried Chicken)
- **Macchiato** (Italian, Pizza, Coffee) - CBD
- **Piato** (Italian?) - Wynyard?
    - Google search shows a location in McMahons Point (near North Sydney), but the person who recommended this place said it's near Wynyard, just that it doesn't show on the map. I don't see any results near Wynyard though, so I'll need to do some exploring. Apparently, it's in Wynyard Metcentre?
    - Apparently, I should try the fettuccini and risotto.
- **Ragazzi** (Italian, Pasta) - CBD
- **Restaurant Hubert** (French) - CBD
    - Quite expensive though.
