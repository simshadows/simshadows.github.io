## Day 1 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1" />

### Part 1 Solution

import Day01Part1 from "./_solutions/day01-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day01Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

I found Part 2 to be a pain in the ass because the exact conditions for a word to count as a number weren't clear.

My first attempt would replace all valid substrings into digits, giving priority to what appears earlier:

import Day01Part2v01 from "./_solutions/day01-part2--01-fail.py?raw" //_

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="Failed Solution">
    <Code code={Day01Part2v01} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

After a bit more thought, I realized the important thing is probably the first and last actual valid word.

In the interest of getting something done quick, I produced a terribly inelegant solution. Both the `#replace first` and `#replace last` blocks of code are near identical and do the same thing, just at different ends of the string. In the case of `#replace first`, it:

1. finds the left-most valid substring,
2. replaces it with a digit (if there is such a substring), then
3. removes all non-numerical character.

The full solution:

## Day 2 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2" />

### Part 1 Solution

My solution just checks if every number of cubes falls within the limits (`R_LIMIT`, `G_LIMIT`, and `B_LIMIT`).

import Day02Part1 from "./_solutions/day02-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day02Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

Straightforward modification that instead just grabs the maximum numbers of red, green, and blue seen within each game.

import Day02Part2 from "./_solutions/day02-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day02Part2} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 3 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3" />

### Part 1 Solution

This one's a real mess to look at due to the loop nesting (2D data structures can be a pain like this) and lots of things happening simultaneously.

My approach starts by padding the grid with an extra end column and end row of `"."`, i.e. the symbol denoting empty space. This simplifies the code since we need to check adjacent cells, and `"."` will simply be read as nothing.

This padding also takes advantage of Python's negative indexing, where `row[-1]` will simply grab the final element of the row (i.e. the final column). For example, if our current location is `(1, 0)` (row 1, column 0), our adjacent cells will include the negative column: `(0, -1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(2, -1)`. These negative column numbers will just map to the final column, which will all be `"."`. In my opinion, this is a nice simplification that means we no longer have to explicitly deal with the edge case within the loop.

The loop itself scans each row for consecutive digits. Every time a digit is found, it updates an accumulator (called `num`). E.g. if the accumulator is `452` and we read in a new digit `7`, the accumulator now becomes `4527`. Every time we read in a non-digit, the accumulator is *flushed*, resetting it to zero.

At the same time, we also scan all adjacent cells for part symbols (`*`, `#`, etc.). If it is, then we record the current accumulator as being a part number (`is_part_num`). That way, by the time the accumulator flushes, we know whether the full number is indeed a part number.

Once again, the `"."` padding helps us simplify our code to avoid explicitly dealing with an edge case. Since the final column is `"."`, we will know that any part number still stored in the accumulator will be forced to flush, and thus be included in the solution.

import Day03Part1 from "./_solutions/day03-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day03Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

We keep a lot of the same tricks as Part 1, but this time, instead of `is_part_num`, we store a set of adjacent gears (`gears`) to the current accumulator value. Every time we *flush* the accumulator, we record every gear we found as being adjacent to the part number (`gear_adjs`).

Then, we just loop through `gear_adjs`, summing up gear ratios (`x[0] * x[1]`) after filtering for gears with exactly two adjacencies (`len(x) == 2`).

## Day 4 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4" />

### Part 1 Solution

We just take a set intersection between what's present on the card and the winning numbers to get the number of winning numbers. Easy!

import Day04Part1 from "./_solutions/day04-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day04Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

I went for a 1D dynamic programming solution. Each card's final value is only dependent on cards of higher indices, so we iterate through the list of cards in reverse.

import Day04Part2 from "./_solutions/day04-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day04Part2} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 5 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5" />

### Part 1 Solution

Each `X-to-Y map:` section is doing basically the same thing, mapping some set of input IDs to some set of output IDs. To avoid code duplication, I wrote ID mapping functionality that is simply reused for each "X-to-Y map:" in the order dictated by `maps_order`.

import Day05Part1 from "./_solutions/day05-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day05Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

To deal with the ranges of seeds, rather than map individual seeds/IDs at a time (as with Part 1), we instead map ranges represented by tuples of starting ID and range length.

Since ID ranges have to occasionally be split, each mapping operation starts with a stack of ID ranges. We pop a range and attempt to map it. If we find a "partial match", then we map the part that can be mapped, then we push back the unmapped parts back to the stack to be reprocessed.

For example, suppose we have the ID range tuple `(7, 4)` representing the IDs `[7, 8, 9, 10]`. This might match with a mapping `31 4 5`, which maps the IDs `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` to the IDs `[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]`. Our ID range tuple only matches on the IDs `[7, 8]`, so we map those two IDs to `[34, 35]`, and the unmatched portion `[9, 10]` is pushed back to the stack as a new ID range tuple `(9, 2)`.

Now, that was actually an oversimplification. My solution actually cheats a little by always pushing the upper unmatched portion and lower unmatched portion back to the stack, even if the unmatched portions might be zero-length. We just filter for zero-length ID ranges with the `if id_len == 0:` branch. This means that even if we find a "full match", we end up pushing two zero-length ranges back to the stack anyway.

For the case where an ID range tuple doesn't match with any mapping, it just maps like you'd expect.

The `grouper()` function is taken directly from [Itertools Recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes) from the official documentation.

## Day 6 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6" />

### Part 1 Solution

I just tried every possible button-hold-time and counted the record-breakers.

import Day06Part1 from "./_solutions/day06-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day06Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

Instead of making lists of integers, I joined the integers together with this line:

```py
    sections = {k.strip(): int("".join(v.strip().split())) for k, v in sections}
```

The full solution:

import Day06Part2 from "./_solutions/day06-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day06Part2} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 7 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7" />

### Part 1 Solution

I used a list of lists of hands. When filling the inner lists, I map the card symbols to a relative strength integer using `label_order`. That way, when I sort the inner list, I can just take advantage of the natural sort order where Python can sort tuples by the tuple contents.

```py
>>> from itertools import count
>>> label_order = {c: i for c, i in zip(reversed("AKQJT98765432"), count())}
>>> label_order
{'2': 0, '3': 1, '4': 2, '5': 3, '6': 4, '7': 5, '8': 6, '9': 7, 'T': 8, 'J': 9, 'Q': 10, 'K': 11, 'A': 12}
```

The inner lists are sorted by natural order before then chained together into a single list `all_sorted`.

The full solution:

import Day07Part1 from "./_solutions/day07-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day07Part1} lang="py" />


### Part 2 Solution

For Part 2, I modified Part 1 to try every possible card that a joker can "mimic", and taking the best strength.

import Day07Part2 from "./_solutions/day07-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day07Part2} lang="py" />

## Day 8 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8" />

### Part 1 Solution

My solution builds a `graph` and just follows the instructions until we reach `ZZZ`.

import Day08Part1 from "./_solutions/day08-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day08Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Failed Brute Force

At each iteration of the loop, I transform a vector of current nodes to a new vector of current nodes. However, I ran it for a few hours (I had to leave my computer anyway lol) and when I got back, it was still running, so it was clear that something smarter was needed.

import Day08Part2v1 from "./_solutions/day08-part2--01-fail.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day08Part2v1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

Here's my original full solution:

import Day08Part2v2 from "./_solutions/day08-part2--02.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day08Part2v2} lang="py" />

Getting an efficient Part 2 solution was a big pain in the ass. At the moment, I'm not sure of a better approach, but here's what I did at the time to get that final solution.

To make progress, I started by exploring the graph, first wondering where each individual `"**A"` starting point went (i.e. the path taken when starting from the individual node) rather than dealing with all the paths at the same time.

My assumption was that we eventually enter a cycle, and within the cycle, there is one or more `"**Z"` exit points. I wanted to know at what point does each individual path enter a cycle, and where the exit points sit in the cycle. Maybe we can do some fancy math with it?

Here are the results of that exploration work:

```
exits: [[20803], [23147], [19631], [13771], [17287], [12599]]

bounds: [(3, 20806), (2, 23149), (2, 19633), (2, 13773), (6, 17293), (2, 12601)]
```

The `exits:` and `bounds:` printouts above correspond to these lines in my solution:

```py
    print("exits:", cycle_exits)
    print()
    print("bounds:", cycle_bounds)
    print()
```

(TODO: Continue this explanation.)

## Day 11 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11" />

### Part 1 BFS Solution

My first solution was a very bad and overly complex approach involving repeated BFS, and takes ages to run.

import Day11Part1v1 from "./_solutions/day11-part1--01-bfs.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day11Part1v1} lang="py" />


### Part 1 "Point List" Mathematical Solution

When I read Part 2, I realized the original approach will scale horribly due to the suddenly massively expanded search space. I decided to start by improving Part 1 to validate a new approach.

The new approach simply involves storing a list of galaxy coordinates (`galaxies`) then doing math on each coordinate and each pair of coordinates. Much more elegant, and runs so much faster!

import Day11Part1v2 from "./_solutions/day11-part1--02-point-list.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day11Part1v2} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

With my faster mathematical solution for Part 1, I made a few modifications to adapt it for Part 2.

I changed the expansion-application to:
```py
# Apply expansion
galaxies = [
    (
        i + (EXPANSION * sum(i > ii for ii in empty_rows)),
        j + (EXPANSION * sum(j > jj for jj in empty_cols)),
    )
    for i, j in galaxies
]
```

and introducing the constant:
```py
EXPANSION = 1000000 - 1
```

## Day 12 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12" />

<Code code={Day12Part1v1} lang="py" />

### Part 1 Backtracking Solution

<Code code={Day12Part1v2} lang="py" />

### Part 1 Dynamic Programming Solution

import Day12Part1v3 from "./_solutions/day12-part1--03-dp.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day12Part1v3} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

My Part 2 solution is a modified version of my Part 1 dynamic programming solution.

Instead of:

```py
springs = "." + springs
groups = tuple(int(x) for x in groups.split(","))
```

we instead have:

```py
springs = ["."] + list("?".join([springs]*5))
groups = [int(x) for x in groups.split(",")]*5
```

and I uncomment the `@cache` line since `subproblem()` runs too slow without memoization.

The full solution is thus:

<Divider />

## Day 13 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13" />

### Part 1 Solution

My solution starts by assuming all possible lines of reflection are valid. For example, `is_horz_reflection` is a list of booleans, each element representing a different vertical line of reflection and whether said line is valid.

My solution then visit each cell one-by-one. For each cell, it tries every possible vertical and horizontal line of reflection by checking if the current cell matches the mirror image cell. If the mirror image cell does not match the current cell, then we mark the corresponding line of reflection as impossible.

After checking every cell and every line of reflection, `is_horz_refl` and `is_vert_refl` should only contain one `True` element between them. This corresponds to the one valid line of reflection for the pattern.

import Day13Part1 from "./_solutions/day13-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day13Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

I mainly modified my Part 1 solution so that we count line-of-reflection breakages for each line of reflection. Thus, we now have:

```py
        horz_refl_breakages = [0]*(len(pattern[0]) - 1)
        vert_refl_breakages = [0]*(len(pattern) - 1)
```

## Day 14 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/14" />

### Part 1 Non-Modifying Two-Pointer Solution

My Part 1 solution is basically a two-pointer solution where I pretend to move the `O` rocks, but I don't actually modify the underlying data structure.

import Day14Part1v1 from "./_solutions/day14-part1--01-non-modifying-2ptr.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day14Part1v1} lang="py" />

### Part 1 Modifying Two-Pointer Solution

To help me out for Part 2, I modified my original Part 1 solution so that instead of pretending to move the `O` rocks without modifying the `rockmap` data structure, we actually do modify it, moving the `O` rocks to new places, then running a `sum()` to get the final answer.

import Day14Part1v2 from "./_solutions/day14-part1--02-modifying-2ptr.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day14Part1v2} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Lazy Solution

Part 2 asks for 1,000,000,000 iterations. Obviously, a brute-force solution shouldn't scale well for simulating all 1,000,000,000 iterations, with my attempt at brute-force taking 5 seconds to run 100,000 iterations. Extrapolating to 1,000,000,000, it would take 14 hours.

*(When I say "iteration", I mean a single set of four pushes: north, then west, then south, then east.)*

The next idea that I tried was the assumption that after enough iterations, we reach a *constant state* of `rockmap` (and therefore also the same "load value"). For example, I was thinking maybe we might see load values <Eq code="\brackets{12, 16, 14, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, \dots}" />, and the pattern of constant <Eq code="15" /> repeats all the way to infinity. However, when you run the brute-force algorithm on the actual puzzle input and print out the load values, we don't observe a constant value.

What we instead observe is a *cycle* of values. For example, maybe we might see load values <Eq code="\brackets{12, 16, 14, 17, 15, 19, 18, 15, 19, 18, 15, 19, 18, \dots}" />. In this example, we notice the repeating cycle of <Eq code="\brackets{15, 19, 18}" />.

Based on this observation, I decided to cheat. Using the printouts, I manually identified the following repeating pattern:

```
[102851, 102834, 102831, 102829, 102827, 102828, 102837]
```

With only 7 possibilities, I submitted each of them until one of them was right. And it worked!

For completeness, I decided to make an automated solution.

### Part 2 Automated Solution

The idea is that we directly calculate intermediate rockmaps and load values while running a cycle detection algorithm on top of it.

To directly calculate intermediate rockmaps, I chose to implement a function that rotates the the entire rockmap 90 degrees clockwise. Though, I could've instead just implemented a version of `push_north()` that just changes direction, or duplicated the `push_north()` function for each cardinal direction, but rotating the whole map just seemed simpler to me at the time.

Unfortunately, I went into this problem with not a lot of experience with cycle-detection algorithms, so there might be something better. Otherwise, my quick-and-dirty cycle detection algorithm works on the assumption that at the end of an iteration (i.e. after pushing north, then west, then south, then east), if the same rockmap appears a second time, then the sequence between and including the two appearances is a repeating cycle of maps. This is because the map itself contains all information on the state of the system at the particular time step. If state <Eq code="A" /> was previously seen to transition to state <Eq code="B" />, then when we see state <Eq code="A" /> again, we know it will transition to state <Eq code="B" /> again.

But on the other hand, if we relied on just reading the load values, this cycle detection algorithm would be insufficient. For example, for the sequence of load values <Eq code="\brackets{1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, \dots}" />, the algorithm may mistakenly think that the subsequence <Eq code="\brackets{1, 2}" /> is the repeated subsequence when the actual repeated subsequence is <Eq code="\brackets{1, 2, 1, 3}" />. In this case, <Eq code="1" /> is not guaranteed to transition to the same load value each time. `rockmap` states don't necessarily map one-to-one to load values (i.e. the mapping is not *bijective*), meaning that two different `rockmap` states may produce the same load value.

Once the cycle detection algorithm identifies the repeated subsequence, we use a bit of modular arithmetic to index into this repeated subsequence to get the final answer.

My full automated solution:

import Day14Part2 from "./_solutions/day14-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day14Part2} lang="py" />

For completeness, let's derive the section where I select the correct element of the repeated subsequence:

```py
    repeated = history[-dist:] # just get the repeated section
    #print(repeated)
    print(repeated[(TARGET_ITERATIONS - end_iteration - 2) % len(repeated)])
```

The important pieces of information we have about the state of the main loop after `break` statement are:

- the length of the repeated subsequence (`dist`),
- the last iteration processed by the main loop (`end_iteration`), and
- the history of load values from each completed iteration of the main loop (`history`).

Additionally, we also have:

- the total number of iterations requested by the problem specification (`TARGET_ITERATIONS`).

For a concrete example, let's assume:

<GatherLatex code="
    \texttt{TARGET\_ITERATIONS} = 10 \\
    \texttt{dist} = 3 \\
    \texttt{end\_iteration} = 4
" />

Visually, this looks like this:

```
All possible iterations:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
`history`:                a b c d e
`repeated`:                   c d e
`end_iteration`:                  ^
```

Intuitively, we can overlay the repeated section over the remaining iterations:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
a b c d e
          c d e
                c d
```

In this situation, it's obvious that the final answer is `repeated_section[1]` since the final iteration (the 9th iteration) will produce load value `d`, which is the second element of `repeated_section`, which is index `1`.

To derive a general solution, we start by cutting the conceptual array of all possible iterations at `end_iteration`:

```
All possible iterations:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Remaining iterations:               0 1 2 3 4

`repeated`:                   c d e
`end_iteration`:                  ^
```

The number of remaining iterations is:

<DisplayLatex code="
    \text{num remaining iterations} = \texttt{TARGET\_ITERATIONS} - \texttt{end\_iteration} - 1
" />

For our concrete example, <Eq code="\text{num remaining iterations} = 10 - 4 - 1 = 5" />.

Due to zero-indexing, to get solution for <Eq code="n" /> iterations, we must get the <Eq code="n - 1" />, modulo the size of the `repeated` sequence.

In code, we might write this out as:

```py
    repeated = history[-dist:] # just get the repeated section
    num_remaining_iterations = TARGET_ITERATIONS - end_iteration - 1
    print(repeated[(num_remaining_iterations - 1) % len(repeated)])
```

which can then be simplified to remove the `num_remaining_iterations` variable.

### Part 1 Solution

<Code code={Day15Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

Such a pain in the ass verbose problem specification in terms of trying to parse out how the algorithm is supposed to work. At least Part 1 was super-simple and easy to skim. Part 2 has relatively many moving parts with the different parts spread out across the problem specification text. The question was obviously designed more as a reading comprehension problem than anything else really.

Along the way, I made two notable misunderstandings of the problem specification:

- I originally thought each box held at most one lens. This led to misunderstanding the functionality of the `-` operation character, particularly the phrase *"move any remaining lenses as far forward in the box as they can go without changing their order"*. I assumed I was meant to shift the lenses to different boxes.
- I originally obtained the box numbers by running the "HASH algorithm" over the entire command string (e.g. running the HASH algorithm over all four characters of `rn=1`) when it should only be run over the "label" portion of the command string (e.g. for `rn=1`, the label is `rn`).

My final solution after resolving all misunderstandings:

## Day 16 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/16" />

### Part 1 Solution

I went for a DFS solution, tracking both position (`i` and `j`) and facing direction unit vectors (`i_dir` and `j_dir`) at each step of the DFS.

We prevent infinite loops by *conceptually* keeping a set of `(i, j, i_dir, j_dir)` tuples. The actual implementation is a 2D grid of sets called `seen`, where the grid indices are `i` and `j` while each set stores the unit direction vectors that have passed through the grid location.

The DFS starts with `travel(0, 0, 0, 1)`, meaning we start at the `i=0` and `j=0` (i.e. the top-left corner) and travelling in the direction of `i_dir=0` and `j_dir=1` (i.e. we are travelling in the positive-j direction).

import Day16Part1 from "./_solutions/day16-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day16Part1} lang="py" />

I didn't actually write out those `elif c = "/":` and `else:` branches like that the first time around. I originally wrote it out explicitly:

```py
        elif c == "/":
            if j_dir == 1:
                travel(i - 1, j, -1, 0)
            elif j_dir == -1:
                travel(i + 1, j, 1, 0)
            elif i_dir == 1:
                travel(i, j - 1, 0, -1)
            else:
                travel(i, j + 1, 0, 1)
        else: # "\"
            if j_dir == 1:
                travel(i + 1, j, +1, 0)
            elif j_dir == -1:
                travel(i - 1, j, -1, 0)
            elif i_dir == 1:
                travel(i, j + 1, 0, 1)
            else:
                travel(i, j - 1, 0, -1)
```

Only after verifying I got the right answer did I refactor to the final version before moving on to Part 2.

### Part 2 Solution

I refactored the Part 1 functionality into a new function `calculate_coverage()` before running `calculate_coverage()` on every possible entrypoint into the grid to get the final answer.

### Part 1 Solution

I went for a Dijkstra's algorithm solution. The cost of a path is the "heat loss", and we further distinguish states not just by position (`i` and `j`), but also travelling-direction unit vectors (`travel_i` and `travel_j`) and the number of steps made in a straight line (`moves`).

### Part 2 Solution

The only modification from my Part 1 solution was the change to this new chunk of code:

```py
        if moves < 10:
            pqpush(cost, i + travel_i, j + travel_j, travel_i, travel_j, moves + 1)
        if 4 <= moves <= 10:
            if travel_i:
                pqpush(cost, i, j + 1, 0, 1, 1)
                pqpush(cost, i, j - 1, 0, -1, 1)
            elif travel_j:
                pqpush(cost, i + 1, j, 1, 0, 1)
                pqpush(cost, i - 1, j, -1, 0, 1)
```

### Part 1 Mathematics Discussion

Mathy question! Let's start with some mathematical analysis.

The simplest starting point to me seems to be to consider the parametric form of the straight line. We're only dealing with the <Eq code="x" /> and <Eq code="y" /> coordinates, so we're obviously only dealing with 2D space.

For the hailstone initial position vector <Eq code="\myvec{p}" /> and velocity vector <Eq code="\myvec{v}" />, we can get the position vector <Eq code="\myvec{x}\parens{t}" /> at time <Eq code="t" />:

<DisplayLatex code="
    \myvec{x}\parens{t} = \myvec{p} + \myvec{v} t
" />

Positions of the hailstone in the *future* will happen at <Eq code="t > 0" />, while positions "in the past" happened at <Eq code="t < 0" />.

Let's try to find where two hailstones intersect. We'll need two equations:

<GatherLatex code="
    \myvec{x}_0 \parens{t_0} = \myvec{p}_0 + \myvec{v}_0 t_0 \tag{d24e1} \\
    \myvec{x}_1 \parens{t_1} = \myvec{p}_1 + \myvec{v}_1 t_1 \tag{d24e2}
" />

We use two separate time variables rather than the same one since we're only looking if the paths will intersect, not necessarily that the hailstones will actually collide.

The two paths intersect when <Eq code="\myvec{x}_0 \parens{t_0} = \myvec{x}_1 \parens{t_1}" />, so we can find the <Eq code="t_0" /> and <Eq code="t_1" /> values with:

<DisplayLatex code="
    \myvec{p}_0 + \myvec{v}_0 t_0 = \myvec{p}_1 + \myvec{v}_1 t_1
" />

At this point, it can be helpful to just break it up into component equations, then solve for one of the <Eq code="t" /> variables:

<GatherLatex code="
    \begin{cases}
        p_{0x} + v_{0x} t_0 = p_{1x} + v_{1x} t_1 \\
        p_{0y} + v_{0y} t_0 = p_{1y} + v_{1y} t_1
    \end{cases}
    \tag{d24e3}
    \\
    \begin{cases}
        t_0 = \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x} + v_{1x} t_1}{v_{0x}} \\
        t_0 = \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y} + v_{1y} t_1}{v_{0y}}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x} + v_{1x} t_1}{v_{0x}}
    = \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y} + v_{1y} t_1}{v_{0y}}
    \\
    \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x}}{v_{0x}}
    - \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y}}{v_{0y}}
    = \frac{v_{1y} t_1}{v_{0y}}
    - \frac{v_{1x} t_1}{v_{0x}}
    \\
    \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x}}{v_{0x}}
    - \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y}}{v_{0y}}
    = t_1 \parens{
        \frac{v_{1y}}{v_{0y}}
        - \frac{v_{1x}}{v_{0x}}
    }
" />

<AlignLatex code="
    t_1
    &= \frac{
        \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x}}{v_{0x}}
        - \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y}}{v_{0y}}
    }{
        \frac{v_{1y}}{v_{0y}}
        - \frac{v_{1x}}{v_{0x}}
    }
    = \frac{
        v_{0y} \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x}}{v_{0x}}
        - \parens{p_{1y} - p_{0y}}
    }{
        v_{1y}
        - v_{0y} \frac{v_{1x}}{v_{0x}}
    }
    \\
    &= \frac{
        v_{0y} \parens{p_{1x} - p_{0x}} - v_{0x} \parens{p_{1y} - p_{0y}}
    }{
        v_{0x} v_{1y} - v_{0y} v_{1x}
    }
    \tag{d24e4}
" />

To solve for the other variable <Eq code="t_0" />, we can simply plug the result of <Eq code="t_1" /> it back into either of the component equations <Eqref>d24e3</Eqref>. For my Part 1 solution, I will use either of these equations depending on whether the denominators are zero:

<AlignLatex code="
    t_0 = \frac{p_{1x} - p_{0x} + v_{1x} t_1}{v_{0x}} \\
    t_0 = \frac{p_{1y} - p_{0y} + v_{1y} t_1}{v_{0y}}
" />

<Todo>Huh. So if either <Eq code="v_{0x}" /> or <Eq code="v_{0y}" /> is zero, that means one of the equations evaluates to an undefined value... intuitively, that makes sense since in one dimension, it will have to be undefined but not in the other dimension. But does that actually make sense mathematically? I should look more into this line of reasoning because I'm not happy with it. Please let me know if there's a better way of thinking about it!</Todo>

Since the question is asking for where the paths intersect only considering the *future*, we can simply check if *both* <Eq code="t_0" /> and <Eq code="t_1" /> are positive.

Now, we'll need to consider how we can handle the edge cases of these results.

Intuitively (and assuming the the past also counts as part of the path), these edge cases are:

1. What if the paths are parallel but never intersect? *In this case, the paths will never intersect.*
2. What if paths are exactly the same? *In this case, we'd need to check if the intersection region happens for positive <Eq code="t_0" /> and <Eq code="t_1" />.*
3. What if any velocity is zero?

I quickly checked the input for zero velocities as a sanity check. **We found no zero velocities, so we can neglect to look for this edge case.** Code snippet used (this code snippet will make sense in the context of my final solution):

```py
def run(f):
    stones = [
        [[int(y.strip()) for y in x.strip().split(",")] for x in s.strip().split("@")]
        for s in f.readlines()
    ]
    if any(all(x == 0 for x in v) for _, v in stones):
        raise RuntimeError(f"We expect no zero velocities.")
```

If any path is parallel but not the same, we intuitively expect to see no possible solution for <Eq code="t_0" /> or <Eq code="t_1" />. If the paths are the same, then we expect to see infinite solutions.

A simple method used by a human might be to first check if the denominator of <Eqref>d24e4</Eqref> is zero, and if so, try checking if any hailstone's <Eq code="t = 0" /> position is a solution to the other hailstone's position equation for <Eq code="t \ge 0" />. If this is true for either hailstone in the manner described, then we know their future paths intersect, otherwise they don't.

Let's try some concrete examples. Suppose we have two lines with a slope of <Eq code="\frac{y}{x} = 1" />:

<GatherLatex code="
    \myvec{p}_0 = {\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}
    \qquad
    \myvec{v}_0 = {\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}
    \\
    \myvec{p}_1 = {\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}
    \qquad
    \myvec{v}_1 = {\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}
" />

Using <Eqref>d24e4</Eqref>, we see we get an undefined result:

<DisplayLatex code="
    t_1
    = \frac{
        1 \parens{2 - 0} - 1 \parens{2 - 0}
    }{
        1 \parens{-1} - 1 \parens{-1}
    }
    = \frac{2 - 2}{\parens{-1} - \parens{-1}}
" />

Let's try solving for <Eq code="t_1" /> if <Eq code="\myvec{p}_0 = \myvec{x}_1 \parens{t_1}" />. From <Eqref>d12e2</Eqref>:

<GatherLatex code="
    {\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}
    = {\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}
    + {\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} t_1
" />

It is trivial to see that this equation is valid and results in <Eq code="t_1 = 2" />. Since this is positive, we know that <Eq code="\myvec{p}_0" /> is a valid solution for the <Eq code="\myvec{x}_1" /> hailstone for positive <Eq code="t_1" />.

### Part 1 Solution

With all the math sorted out in the previous section, the implementation is actually quite straightforward! We just look at every pair of hailstones and count the intersections.

import Day24Part1 from "./_solutions/day24-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day24Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Mathematics Discussion

The first approach I will try is to grab any two hailstones and come up with some set of solutions to throw a rock such that it will hit both hailstones. Such a set of solutions may be parameterized in some way to account for every possible way the two hailstones can be hit.

Once we have the set of solutions, we can try introducing another hailstone to somehow narrow down this set of solutions. And as long as there's only one solution, surely that should be the one solution that works for the full set of hailstones? It may even be possible that we solve this entirely analytically without writing any code.

Let's try it out!

Same as with Part 1, let's begin with two hailstone trajectories, though the vectors are now in <Eq code="\Reals^3" />. We use the same time variable now since we need the actual hailstone position at a point in time.

<GatherLatex code="
    \myvec{x}_0 \parens{t} = \myvec{p}_0 + \myvec{v}_0 t \tag{d24e5} \\
    \myvec{x}_1 \parens{t} = \myvec{p}_1 + \myvec{v}_1 t \tag{d24e6}
" />

The rock trajectory will be defined the same way, but with an <Eq code="x" /> subscript:

<DisplayLatex code="
    \myvec{x}_x \parens{t} = \myvec{p}_x + \myvec{v}_x t \tag{d24e7}
" />
