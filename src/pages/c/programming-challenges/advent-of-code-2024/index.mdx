All solutions on this page were written by me without reading any hints or solutions.

My solutions aren't necessarily great, but they did the job and got me the answers.

My suggestion to run these solutions:
```
$ cat input.txt | ./solution.py
```

Links to the full challenge specifications are included throughout this document. The original specifications aren't allowed to be reproduced, so I can't repost them here.

## Day 1 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1" />

### Part 1 Solution

import Day01Part1 from "./_solutions/day01-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day01Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

import Day01Part2 from "./_solutions/day01-part2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day01Part2} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 2 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2" />

### Part 1 Solution

import Day02Part1 from "./_solutions/day02-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day02Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

My first solution:

import Day02Part2v1 from "./_solutions/day02-part2-v1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day02Part2v1} lang="py" />

In an attempt to make a more compact solution, I reimplemented with a lambda:

import Day02Part2v3 from "./_solutions/day02-part2-v3.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day02Part2v3} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 3 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3" />

### Part 1 Solution

I cheated by using `eval()` rather than parsing out the `mul()` myself:

import Day03Part1 from "./_solutions/day03-part1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day03Part1} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

My first solution, retaining the use of `eval()`:

import Day03Part2v1 from "./_solutions/day03-part2-v1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day03Part2v1} lang="py" />

My attempt at making a more compact solution:

import Day03Part2v2 from "./_solutions/day03-part2-v2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day03Part2v2} lang="py" />


<Divider />

## Day 4 <Spec href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4" />

### Part 1 Solution

My first attempt gets the right solution, but the approach is quite ugly:

import Day04Part1v1 from "./_solutions/day04-part1-v1.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day04Part1v1} lang="py" />

*(Yes, I'm just trying to make meme solutions. That's why it's so ugly lol.)*

Alternative, nicer solution that just indexes into the existing graph:

import Day04Part1v2c from "./_solutions/day04-part1-v2c.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day04Part1v2c} lang="py" />

### Part 2 Solution

import Day04Part2v2 from "./_solutions/day04-part2-v2.py?raw" //_

<Code code={Day04Part2v2} lang="py" />
