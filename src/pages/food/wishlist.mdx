    - Google search shows a location in McMahons Point (near North Sydney), but the person who recommended this place said it's near Wynyard, just that it doesn't show on the map. I don't see any results near Wynyard though, so I'll need to do some exploring. Apparently, it's in Wynyard Metcentre?
    - Apparently, I should try the fettuccini and risotto.
- **Ragazzi** (Italian, Pasta) - CBD
- **Restaurant Hubert** (French) - CBD
    - Quite expensive though.
