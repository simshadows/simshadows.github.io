*Very early work-in-progress page! I'll be using this page to collect my thoughts on food places I recommend! I'm still exploring food places and figuring out what criteria I would use to add a food place to my list.*

## Sydney, Australia

- **Gumshara** (Japanese, Ramen) (2024-05-12)
    - They specialize in a unique style of thick tonkotsu ramen.
    - Gumshara is a bit polarizing. I absolutely love it, but some people think it's gimmicky and hate it. Regardless, I reckon they're worth trying at least once!
    - They don't do bookings. Expect very long lines. Also, I recommend paying with physical cash.
- **Umami Dojo** (Japanese, Ramen) (2024-08-03)
    - Great food in a quaint and intimate hole-in-the-wall setting.
    - They made the best karaage chicken I've ever had. So tender, juicy, and covered in a crispy breading.
    - You should book for this place. It's a very small shop, so you may show up only to see a sign saying no walk-ins for the day.
