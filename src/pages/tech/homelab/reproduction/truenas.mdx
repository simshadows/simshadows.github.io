## Setting up the Proxmox VM

TODO

## Credentials > Groups

In addition to pre-existing groups:

- `share-rw`
    - This group will be granted the broadest **read-write** permissions on all shares expect for some special ones.
- `share-ro`
    - This group will be granted the broadest **read-only** permissions on all shares expect for some special ones.
- `app-file-browser`
    - Specifically intended for TrueNAS file browser apps.
    - TODO: I don't actually know yet if this does anything since users log in with their own credentials?

## Credentials > Users

- `root` (it exists by default)
- `truenas_admin` (it exists by default)
    - It should already have the auxiliary group `builtin_administrators`.
- `simshadows`
    - (Don't create a new primary group for this user.)
    - **Primary group:** `share-rw`
- `simshadows-ro`
    - (Don't create a new primary group for this user.)
    - **Primary group:** `share-ro`
- `otheruser`
    - (This isn't the actual name of the group, but I will use it as a placeholder for user accounts I am creating for anybody else in the household.)
    - (We create a primary group for these users.)

## Storage

*Self-explanatory.*

## Datasets

*Mostly self-explanatory.*

Here's my template for how I set up the ACL for a "main dataset" (written out in a way that corresponds with the TrueNAS GUI):

- **Owner:** `root`
- **Owner Group:** `builtin_administrators`

ACL:

<table class="general">
<thead>
<tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>Flag</th>
    <th>`rwx`</th>
    <th>Why?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>User Obj</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="4">`rwx`</td>
    <td rowspan="4">Whoever owns the file/directory gets to do whatever with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>User Obj</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group Obj</td>
    <td></td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group Obj</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">`---`</td>
    <td rowspan="2">No access by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Mask</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">`rwx`</td>
    <td rowspan="2">(I'm actually not entirely sure what this is for yet.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Mask</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `builtin_administrators`</td>
    <td>default</td>
    <td>`rwx`</td>
    <td>Allows `truenas_admin` to manage everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `share-rw`</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">`rwx`</td>
    <td rowspan="2"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `share-rw`</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `share-ro`</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">`r-x`</td>
    <td rowspan="2">TODO: I'm not entirely sure what permissions this should be yet. I'll figure it out later after I'm done experimenting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `share-ro`</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `app-file-browser`</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">`r-x`</td>
    <td rowspan="2">By default everything can be read by the TrueNAS file browser app.<br/>(Add `w` if you're feeling brave.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Group - `app-file-browser`</td>
    <td>default</td>
    {/* <td></td> */}
    {/* <td></td> */}
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Apps

I install `filebrowser` only. Immediately after installing it, make sure to set **Group ID** to the ID for `app-file-browser`, and <span style="color:red;">**in the file browser web UI, you must change the username and password of the default user**</span>.

## Data Protection > Scrub Tasks

These tasks are for checking for and fixing bit rot.

You should already have a weekly scrub task for each pool by default. If you don't, here's what I see for each of my scrub tasks:

- **Pool:** *(Select the pool here.)*
- **Threshold Days:** 35
- **Description:** *(empty)*
- **Schedule:** `Custom (00 00 * * 7) At 12:00 AM, only on Sunday``
- *Make sure that the Enabled slider is set.*

You may need to make this run less frequently if your pool sizes are really big.

## Data Protection > Periodic S.M.A.R.T. Tests

Create two entries:

- Entry 1:
    - **All Disks:** *true*
    - **Type:** `SHORT`
    - **Description:** `SHORT Weekly`
    - **Schedule:** *Select the Weekly one. Doesn't matter exactly when it triggers.*
- Entry 2:
    - **All Disks:** *true*
    - **Type:** `LONG`
    - **Description:** `LONG Bi-monthly`
    - **Schedule:** *Select the Custom one.*
        - **Presets:** *Initially set this to `Monthly`, then change the rest of the settings.*
        - **Hours:** 1
        - **Days:** 1
        - **Days of Week:** *Unset them all.*
        - **Months:** `Feb`, `Apr`, `Jun`, `Aug`, `Oct`, `Dec`
        - *In effect, this should run at 1am on day 1 of each of those six months per year.*

## Data Protection > Periodic Snapshot Tasks

Set one for each pool.

Here's a good baseline:

- **Dataset:** *(Select the pool here.)*
- **Snapshot Lifetime:** `4 WEEK`
- **Schedule:** `Daily (0 0 * * *) At 00:00 (12:00 AM)`
- **Recursive:** *true*

## Data Protection > (the other options)

Under *Data Protection*, you have a bunch of options for backups:

- (TODO)

## Notification Emails

Gmail OAuth works for me.

(TODO: Outline what you need to get this working!)
