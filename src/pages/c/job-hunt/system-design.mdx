## Resources

- [AusDevs Wiki: Interviewing Resources](https://ausdevs.com/resources/interviewing/)
    - *I actually help maintain this wiki. We aim to make it a great meta-resource!*
- [GitHub: donnemartin / system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
    - *I'm largely studying this document, so my notes will retain a lot of the structure from it.*


## Distributed Systems Concepts

- Performance vs. Scalability
    - **Performance:** "How it is normally."
    - **Scalability:** "It's slow under heavy load."
    - **Scalability:** "Adding resources improves performance linearly."
- Latency vs. Throughput
- CAP Theorem (for distributed systems)
    - **CAP Theorem:** Can only guarantee two properties of:
        - **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
        - **Availability:** Every request receives a non-error response. *(Not necessarily the most recent.)*
        - **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate even with arbitrary network failures/delays.
    - Choices of guarantees:
        - <Exn>**CA:** Consistency + Availability</Exn>
            - <Exn>Networks are never reliable. Almost never choose CA.</Exn>
        - **CP:** Consistency + Partition Tolerance
            - Good if you need atomic reads/writes.
            - <Todo>Atomic in what way?</Todo>
        - **AP:** Availability + Partition Tolerance
            - Good if you need reliable access to the system.
            - <Todo>It also talks about a business needing eventual consistency. Why would a business need it specifically?</Todo>
- Consistency Patterns
    - **Weak Consistency:** After a write, reads may or may not see it.
        - Example: real-time use cases like VoIP and multiplayer games.
    - **Eventual Consistency:** After a write, reads will eventually see it. (Typically milliseconds.)
        - Useful if you need high availability.
        - Example: DNS and email.
    - **Strong consistency:** After a write, reads will always see it.
        - Useful if you need transactions.
        - <Todo>What is a transaction?</Todo>
        - Example: File systems and RDBMSes.
- Availability Patterns
    - **Active-Passive Failover:**
        - Active server normally manages traffic.
        - Only one "IP address" is needed.
            - <Todo>Be more clear that "IP address" doesn't necessarily mean a literal IP address?</Todo>
        - If active server heartbeats stop, passive server takes over the "IP address".
    - **Active-Active Failover:**
        - Load is spread between both servers.
        - Requires "two IP addresses".
            - <Todo>Be more clear that this doesn't necessarily mean literal IP addresses?</Todo>
    - **Master-Slave Replication:**
        - One master, many slaves.
        - Master server can read/write. Slave servers can only read.
        - If master fails, a slave can be promoted to master.
    - **Master-Master Replication:**
        - All servers are masters and can all read/write.
    - <Todo>Talk more about the advantages/disadvantages of each approach?</Todo>
- Availability also depends on whether components are in series or parallel.
    - 99.9% availability in series with 99.9% = 99.8%
    - 99.9% availability in parallel with 99.9% = 99.9999%
