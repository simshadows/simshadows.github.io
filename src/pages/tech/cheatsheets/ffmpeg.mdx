This page is my personal cheatsheet of common FFmpeg commands I regularly use.

*THIS PAGE IS A VERY EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS.*

*I still need to migrate all my notes onto here, but I also want to test the commands before moving them over.*

## Basic Operations Without Re-encoding

```bash
# Cut (crude, by keyframe):
ffmpeg -ss 01:51:50 -i in.mkv -t 128 -c copy out.mkv

# Extract audio
ffmpeg -i in.mkv -vn -acodec copy out-audio.mp4

# Remove audio
ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c copy -an out.mkv
```

## Concatenation Without Re-encoding

```bash
# Concatenation, no re-encoding
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy out.mkv
```

Example `mylist.txt` file contents to concatenate three files in order:
```
# comments begin with a hash symbol
file 'FILENAME1.mkv'
file 'FILENAME2.mkv'
file 'FILENAME3.mkv'
```
