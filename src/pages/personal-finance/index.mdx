title: My Thoughts On Personal Finance In Australia
description: "My thoughts on personal finance, focused mostly towards my particular situation as an Australian professional with a habit of frugality, and also including my thoughts on what I reckon other Australians should look into. My website does not constitute personal financial advice. I just provide ideas on what to look into."

*This is a very early work-in-progress. I'm still figuring out how to write out this page.*

*For now, I can at least compile the resources I've seen or like.*

## Preface

Everything on this page is just my thoughts on personal finance in <u>**Australia**</u>. Different countries differ in finance products, legislation, economic conditions, and other factors, so if you are not from Australia, the contents of this page may not be as directly applicable.

As is standard with general personal finance resources, nothing on this page or pages within constitute financial advice in the legal sense. I am not even a finance professional. You will need to consider many different factors of your personal situation. <u>**Everything**</u> in personal finance comes with risk and tradeoffs, and mistakes in managing your personal finances can be extremely costly. Seek professional financial advice if you need assistance.

Everything on this page must only be taken as suggestions on what to look into.

## Finding Professional Financial Advice

I don't have any experience or resources with seeking financial advice, but I liked [this Rational Reminder episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKlmgA4P4ME). I recommend you watch it before seeking any sort of professional financial advice.

I should find more resources on how to seek financial advice. It's a very important topic.

## Resources I Can Vouch

Here are some resources I've personally used and can personally recommend openly, and in alphabetical order, giving no particular preference to any resource. There's a lot of overlap in these resources, as well as some particular strengths/focuses. I like them all though. I recommend checking through them and just consuming the resources that suit your needs and tastes.

- Ben Felix and PWL Capital Media Projects
    - [YouTube: Ben Felix (Common Sense Investing)](https://www.youtube.com/@BenFelixCSI)
    - [YouTube: The Money Scope Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@moneyscopepod)
    - [YouTube: The Rational Reminder Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@rationalreminder)
- [YouTube: The Financial Diet](https://www.youtube.com/c/thefinancialdiet)
- [YouTube: The Plain Bagel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePlainBagel)
- [YouTube: Two Cents](https://www.youtube.com/c/TwoCentsPBS)

## More Resources

These resources look good from what little I've seen, but I don't feel familiar enough to recommend them until I properly consume them. Still, I reckon it's worth at least skimming through and seeing if they're useful to you! Also listed in alphabetical order to avoid giving preference.

- [CommBank: The Brighter Side of Banking](https://www.commbank.com.au/brighter.html)
    - *I've read an issue back-to-back on a commute and it seems good to me, but you'll need to keep in mind the conflicts of interest here when offered advice from a big bank. I recommend just reading through the more informational articles like guides on things to look into to maximize your tax refund. There can be some great tidbits on stuff like that. Maybe I should compile a list of articles I liked?*
- Economics Explained
    - *I love this channel and can absolutely vouch for its quality, but it's not quite personal finance. It covers economics more broadly in a very interesting way, which in my opinion provides interesting context or ways of thinking.*
    - [YouTube: Economics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/EconomicsExplained)
    - [YouTube: Epic Economics](https://www.youtube.com/@EconomicsIsEpic)
- [Passive Investing Australia](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/)
    - *I see this resource recommended a lot, and the topics covered look really good to me. However, I didn't use this resource when I was learning, so it's hard for me to give it a full recommendation.*
- [Pearler Blogs](https://pearler.com/explore/learn)
    - *I'm yet to look through the blog deeply, but it's worth keeping in mind conflicts of interest in getting you to use their product. The advice might be great, but it also serves to push you into their investing product which you will may or may not prefer over other investing products.*
- [The Barefoot Investor [PAID RESOURCE]](https://www.barefootinvestor.com/)
    - *Another popular recommendation I see.*
