## Build Objectives

- "Practically unlimited" budget, though spending has to be within reason. I won't double the build's cost just to squeeze 1% more performance.
- [This is my current build](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/simshadows/saved/fvZ4gs). I will be reusing many parts.

## Components I've settled on

I'm already settled on the following components unless there is an objectively better-performing component with no compromises:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9950X3D
- Main storage: Samsung 990 Pro 5TB (M.2 NVMe SSD)
- Extra case fans: *Appropriately-sized premium Noctua fans.*

I will also be reusing my existing components:

- GPU: Nvidia RTX 4090 (air cooled, 337mm long) *(TODO: Verify the length?)*
- *Various existing 3.5"/2.5"/M.2 drives.*

## Components I'm having trouble picking

### CPU Cooler

#### > Noctua NH-D15 G2 (Air)

- [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/8c88TW/noctua-nh-d15-g2-9158-cfm-cpu-cooler-nh-d15-g2)

#### > Arctic Liquid Freezer III (AIO)

- 360mm version:
- 420mm version:
- **Pros:**
    - Effectively the best cooler on the market.
- **Cons:**
    - It's an AIO, so it will be less-reliable and have a shorter lifespan.

### Motherboards

#### General Expectations

- I will expect at least 4 SATA ports.
- I will expect at least 3 M.2 M-key slots.
- I will expect built-in Wi-Fi, though I can survive without it.
- Before purchase, I must check case compatibility.

    - [ATX X870/X870E/X670E](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/products/motherboard/#f=2&c=159,166,167&sort=price&xcx=0&K=4,13&E=2,7&V=10000,9000,8000,6000), but the only boards with >4 SATA ports are expensive X670E boards.
        - [Expanding to EATX](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/products/motherboard/#f=2,3&c=159,166,167&sort=price&xcx=0&K=5,13&E=2,7&V=10000,9000,8000,6000), we find motherboards with 6 built-in ports, but they're expensive.

#### > ASRock X870E Taichi Lite EATX AM5

- [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/pcdG3C/asrock-x870e-taichi-lite-eatx-am5-motherboard-x870e-taichi-lite)
- **Pros:** It's an X870E board with 6x SATA ports!


#### > ASRock X870E Taichi EATX AM5

- [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/6HkH99/asrock-x870e-taichi-eatx-am5-motherboard-x870e-taichi)
- It is literally the exact same as its Lite variant. Same components, same performance, same everything.
- You're literally paying $70 more for a black-and-gold aesthetic.
- Can be worth it if you have a tempered glass build!

### RAM

#### General Expectations

- Must be 6000MHz because of AMD hardware limitations.
- Minimum 2x 32GB kit.

### Cases

#### General Expectations

- Supports my existing RTX 4090, which is [337mm](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/Jj8bt6/pny-verto-geforce-rtx-4090-24-gb-video-card-vcg409024tfxpb1).
- Supports at least 2x 3.5" drives. (I do a lot of video work, and sometimes I want to work with huge files!)
- Supports at least 2x 2.5" drives.
- Reasonable thermal performance.
- Must have dust filters or equivalent meshes. Cases with only highly-permissive meshes on the intakes are not desired.
- I'd like a GPU bracket, but realistically, most cases don't have one.

#### > Fractal Design Define R5

- [official site](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-r5/) | [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/sjX2FT/fractal-design-case-fdcadefr5bk)
- **External 5.25":** 2
- **3.5" / 2.5":** 4 / 2 (using one 5.25" slot, and with the RTX 4090)
    - Can fit lots more without the RTX 4090.
- **Height:** 521mm
- **Pros:**
    - Appropriate for **home server conversion**.
- **Cons:**
    - **Unknown thermal performance.** It's an old-design case with a solid front door. I should find some benchmarks though. And maybe I can brute force it by just adding more fans? The case can support a lot of fans.
    - **Outdated USB 2.0 front panel.**
    - The second 5.25" external drive bay is wasted space.

#### > Fractal Design North XL

- [official site](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/north/north-xl/chalk-white/) | [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/MydG3C/fractal-design-north-xl-atx-full-tower-case-fd-c-nor1x-03)
- **3.5" / 2.5":** 2 / 2
- **Height:** 509mm
- **Pros:**

- **3.5" / 2.5":** 4 / 2
- **Height:** 520mm
- You'll need to buy the USB-C port separately.
- **Cons:**
    - No front filter.

#### > Fractal Design Torrent

- [official site](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/torrent/torrent/) | [manual](https://www.fractal-design.com/app/uploads/2024/10/Torrent-manual-v.1.1_2024-10-28.pdf) | [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/4svdnQ/fractal-design-torrent-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-tor1a-05)

- **3.5" / 2.5":** 3 / 2
- **Height:** 384mm
- **Pros:**
    - The smallest possible case that fits my needs. (It's a dual chamber case.)
- **Cons:**
    - No front filter.
    - **GPU Thermals:** It's bad. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mawWXmR0j48))
    - Very tight clearance for some 2.5" drives.
    - Poor QC.

#### > Lian Li Lancool III

- [official site](https://lian-li.com/product/lancool-iii/) | [pcpartpicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/2vJgXL/lian-li-lancool-iii-atx-mid-tower-case-lancool-3-x)
- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjb5wozsMdc) | [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBrtKpDaq1M)
- **3.5" / 2.5":** 4 / ?
