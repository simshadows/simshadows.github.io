This is the original LaTeX version of "Databases: The Relational Model and Relational Algebra", modified to isolate it from the original document. Everything you need to recompile it is here if you want to recompile.

These files exist here for reference, in case I want to remake it into a PDF version and want to use it as reference, or to check if I made a mistake with migrating the notes to this website.

I have since deleted it from the original repository.
