## Kattis: Need for Speed <Spec href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/speed" cdate="2024-03-21" />

*This problem was solved in the context of competitive programming practice, solving problems in a group setting. I was the writer, but other members of the group provided the vast majority of the thinking/solving.*

The group's original solution:

import SolNeedForSpeed01 from "./_solutions.kattis/need-for-speed--01-pass.py?raw" //_

<SpoilerBlock buttonLabel="Original Group Solution">
    <Code code={SolNeedForSpeed01} lang="py" />
</SpoilerBlock>

I also did a little bit of cleanup afterwards on my own for a nicer solution:

import SolNeedForSpeed02 from "./_solutions.kattis/need-for-speed--02-pass.py?raw" //_

<Code code={SolNeedForSpeed02} lang="py" />
