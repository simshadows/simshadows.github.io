### Australia - Sydney

- <Ve n="15cenchi" c="Japanese; Cheesecake" l="CBD, Darling Square"/>
- <Ve n="Angel's Filipino Barbeque" c="Filipino; BBQ" l="Blacktown"/>
- <Ve n="Azuki Bakery" c="Japanese; Bread; Cake" l="Newtown"/>
- <Ve n="Bosphorus" c="Turkish" l="Wentworth Point"/>
    - I was recommended the turkish breakfast, but it probably only runs on Saturdays. Info is on [their instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bosphorusturkishstreetfood/).
- <Ve n="Caysorn" c="Southern Thai" l="Haymarket"/>
    - Items I want to try:
        - Gang Bai-Cha-Plu Nue Pu
            - Unique crab curry, but it's expensive.
        - Kao Mok Kai
            - "Thai Biryani"
        - Seafood Ya Ten Four
            - Soupy thick wide noodle.
- <Ve n="Gold Class Daruma" c="Japanese; Sushi; Omakase" l="CBD"/>
    - Quite expensive.
- The various Ho Jiak locations are somewhat different restaurants so I will list them individually.
    - <Ve n="Ho Jiak Haymarket" c="Malaysian" l="Haymarket"/>
    - <Ve n="Ho Jiak Town Hall" c="Malaysian" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Macchiato" c="Italian; Pizza; Coffee" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Molly Tea" c="Tea" l="Darling Square"/>
- <Ve n="Piato" c="Italian?" l="Wynyard?"/>
    - Google search shows a location in McMahons Point (near North Sydney), but the person who recommended this place said it's near Wynyard, just that it doesn't show on the map. I don't see any results near Wynyard though, so I'll need to do some exploring. Apparently, it's in Wynyard Metcentre?
    - Apparently, I should try the fettuccini and risotto.
- <Ve n="Ragazzi" c="Italian; Pasta" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Restaurant Hubert" c="French" l="CBD"/>
    - Quite expensive though.
- <Ve n="Toki Italian Inspired" c="Italian" l="CBD, Woolloomooloo"/>

        - I also got recommended the naan but I can't find it on the website.
- <Ve n="Brunetti Classico" c="Italian" l="Carlton"/>
- <Ve n="Delhi Rocks" c="Indian" l="(various locations)"/>
    - The CBD store has a lot of Google reviews.

Poutine places:

- <Ve n="Brüger" c="Burgers" l="Footscray"/>
    - Probably worth trying!
- <Ve n="F.A.T. Fried and Tasty" c="Fried Chicken" l="Brunswick East"/>
    - Their poutine seems to use cheese rather than cheese curds.
    - Still seems like a good place even if the poutine isn't authentic.
- <Ve n="Juanita Peaches" c="American" l="Brunswick"/>
    - The poutine photos look unimpressive, but I may as well drop in and try the poutine if I'm in the area. Maybe it's better than it looks?
- <Ve n="Tallboy & Moose" c="Pub" l="Preston"/>
    - Looks authentic. I should give them a try.
    - Do they also serve Caesar cocktail? I should probably also try one while I'm there.
- <Ve n="That Burger Joint" c="Burgers" l="St Kilda; Fitzroy North"/>
- <Ve n="The Beast" c="Burgers" l="Brunswick East"/>
    - Their poutine seems to use cheese rather than cheese curds.
- <Ve n="Tramway Hotel" c="Pub" l="Fitzroy North"/>
    - Their poutine seems to use cheese rather than cheese curds.

Places near Tullamarine Airport for a convenient meal before/after a flight:

- <Ve n="AFL Kitchen & Bar" c="Western" l="Melbourne Airport"/>
    - Seems extremely mediocre yet overpriced. Go for the novelty, not for good food.
    - Might walk past and have a look at the food quality served to the patrons. If it looks alright, I might try a burger.
- <Ve n="Bar Pulpo by MoVida" c="Spanish; Bar" l="Melbourne Airport"/>
    - Recommended by Reddit.
    - **This place would be my top priority but sadly, they're airside in the international terminals.**
- <Ve n="Hanna's Cafe" c="Cafe" l="Melbourne Airport"/>
    - Recommended by Reddit.
    - Check closing times. Last I checked, it closes 5:30pm on weekdays.
    - Seems like the food quality is probably great, but not very unique. It's an option if the more unique restaurants are unavailable.
- <Ve n="Biggie Smalls" c="Western" l="Melbourne Airport"/>
    - Seems like one of the better more interesting places on Google Maps.
    - **This place is my #1 priority.**

### Australia (Chains)

- <Ve n="400 Gradi" c="Italian; Pizza" l="(various locations)"/>
    - It's basically a Melbourne chain. Lots of Melbourne locations.
    - I list it under Australia Chains because they have a SA location.
    - Expect about $30 per dish.
    - If you want water, always specifically ask for tap water, otherwise they will sneakily give you fancy water.
- <Ve n="DOC Pizza & Mozzarella Bar" c="Italian; Pizza" l="Carlton, Melbourne; Surry Hills, Sydney"/>
- <Ve n="Dodee Paidang" c="Thai" l="(various locations)"/>
    - Flagships store in Sydney, more stores in Melbourne.
- <Ve n="Gami Chicken & Beer" c="Korean; Fried Chicken" l="(various locations)"/>
- <Ve n="Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken" c="Fried Chicken" l="(various locations)"/>
- <Ve n="Lune Croissanterie" c="Croissants" l="(various locations)"/>
- <Ve n="Shanghai Street" c="Shanghainese; Chinese" l="(various locations)"/>
