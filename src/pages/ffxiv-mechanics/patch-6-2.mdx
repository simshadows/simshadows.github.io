## [P8S p1] Abyssos: The Eighth Circle (Savage), Phase 1

My notes are only applicable for melee DPS.

Recurring mechanics:

- **"Bird/Snake" [Sunforge]**: Bird = middle is safe. Snake = out-of-middle is safe.
- **"Octa/Tetra" [Octaflare/Tetraflare]**: Octa = everyone spread. Tetra = pair stacks.
- **"Octa/Tetra/Di Storage" [Conceptual Octaflare/Tetraflare/Diflare]**: Same thing, but the mechanic is stored for later. *(Diflare = LP stacks)*
- **"Gaze/Kill"**: Face a snake to petrify it. Drop the "green AOE" on it to kill it.
- *<span class="mech">Reforged Reflection</span> is always <span class="important">Centaur&rarr;Snake&rarr;Centaur&rarr;Snake</span> or <span class="important">Snake&rarr;Centaur&rarr;Snake&rarr;Centaur</span>.*

Phases:

1. **[Volcanic Torches 1]** Octa/Tetra storage; One safe square per quadrant; Bird/Snake.
2. **[Reforged Reflection 1]** <span class="important">KB-res early in cast.</span> *Either of two phases happens:*
    - **[Centaur 1]**: Spread. Count AOE order. Bait in order.
    - **[Snake 1]**: Look-aways; Freeze the adds, kill with green AOEs.
3. **[Illusory Creation]**
    1. Bird + Snake; Spread; If not hit, bait earthshakers.
    2. Double-bird/snake. <span class="important"><span class="mech">Nest of Flamevipers</span> = spread for line AOEs</span>, else pair-stacks.
4. **[Volcanic Torches 2]** One safe square. Just pay attention to SW corner.
5. *Repeat Reforged Reflection 1 with the phase you didn't get.*
6. **[Fourfold Fires]**
    1. <span class="important">Octa/Tetra storage.</span>
    2. Three huge corner explosions. Octa/Tetra on the second one.
    3. Bird/snake with stored stack/spread resolving after the third.
7. **[Reforged Reflection 2]** <span class="important">KB-res IF CENTAUR ONLY.</span> *Either of two phases happens:*
    - **[Centaur 2]**
        1. Impact = Go front, crush = back. <span class="important">Di/Tetra storage.</span>
        {/* <!-- 2. Charge-through &rarr; edge KB/AOE &rarr; charge-through &rarr; edge KB/AOE &rarr; volcanic torches --> */}
        2. Charge with <span class="important">Di/Tetra resolving</span> &rarr; <span class="important">Edge</span> &rarr; Charge &rarr; <span class="important">Edge</span> &rarr; Volcanic Torches
        3. <span class="important">Remember to preposition to the correct north/south side during the first edge mechanic!</span>
    - **[Snake 2]**:
        - Don't kill "green AOE". LoS and stack+kill with "purple AOE".
        - <span class="important">Last clone spawns after the second set of stack/kill go off. FIND IT.</span>
8. *Repeat Reforged Reflection 2 with the phase you didn't get.*

Tips and tricks:

- **[Reforged Reflection 1/2]**: <span class="important">Always pop KB resist if it's off cooldown</span>, about one GCD after Reforged Reflection finishes casting. Aside from the first Reforged Reflection, you will always know whether it's Snake or Centaur based on whether or not KB resist is on cooldown.
- **[Fourfold Fires]**: During movements, move towards mid-east or mid-west (depending on your role) if you're still reading where the snakes are moving. As soon as you know where you're supposed to be, <span class="important">pop sprint</span>.
- **[Snake 2]**: <span class="important">The last clone spawns when the second gaze/kill resolves, and has a bright visual effect when it spawns.</span> Get ready to spot it very early, especially to take advantage of the visual effect! There's very little time otherwise, and the clone can be very difficult to spot because the fight is so visually busy.

## [P8S p2] Abyssos: The Eighth Circle (Savage), Phase 2

My notes are only applicable for melee DPS.

Recurring mechanics:

- **"Safe Side" [Ashing Blaze]**: Half the arena (east or west) is cleaved.
- **[High Concept 1/2]**
    - \{&alpha; &xharr; &#9650;\} \{&beta; &xharr; &#9660;\} \{&gamma; &xharr; L-shape\}
    - *"Element"* = the coloured hexagons symbol.
    - *"Nothing"* = you have no debuff.
    - *"Unused"* = an element symbol that was unused for the first two puddles.
    - *"Animal"* = the "animal" symbol above your head after your combine two elements.

Phases:

1. **[Natural Alignment 1]**
    1. Drop puddles &rarr; Stack/Spread &rarr; "Safe Side" &rarr; &#128472;Stack/Spread
    2. Fire = 3 furthest; Ice = 2 closest. *<span class="important">Fire = "Far T-shape"</span>*
2. **[High Concept 1]**
    1. \{Short &alpha;&beta;&gamma; &rarr; Out\} \{Else &rarr; Stacks\}
    2. Match+soak puddles. <span class="important">"Safe side".</span>
    3. \{Long &alpha;&beta;&gamma; &rarr; Out\} \{Nothing OR Unused &rarr; Soak &alpha;&beta;&gamma;\} \{Animal &rarr; Standby\}
    4. Match+soak puddles. <span class="important">\{Had Long &alpha;&beta;&gamma; &rarr; COMBINE\}</span> \{Else &rarr; COMBINE\}
3. **[Limitless Desolation]**
    - Spread &rarr; When hit, prepos near your tower &rarr; Dodge puddle + Soak tower
4. **[Natural Alignment 2]** Read which mechs are inverted.
5. **[High Concept 2]**
    1. \{Short &alpha;&beta;&gamma; &rarr; Out\} <span class="important">\{Nothing &rarr; Soak &alpha;, COMBINE\}</span> \{Else &rarr; Stacks\}
    2. Match+soak puddles. <span class="important">"Safe side".</span>
    3. \{Long &alpha;&beta;&gamma; &rarr; Out\} <span class="important">\{Else &rarr; Standby\}</span>
    4. Match+soak puddles, bait clones. <span class="important">\{Long &alpha;&beta; &rarr; COMBINE\}</span> \{Leftover elements &rarr; COMBINE\}
    5. Red + Green &rarr; COMBINE
6. **[Dominion]** Spread. If you weren't hit, you take first towers. *Repeat.*

Fire/Ice decision tree for *Scripe Strat*:

<ScripeTree />

Tips and tricks:

- **[High Concept 1/2]**: Learn to linger around the middle in between mechanics to let healers heal you.
- **[High Concept 2]**: If you're baiting the clones, <span class="important">pop sprint</span>!
- **[Natural Alignment 2]**: Watch for who has the inverse debuff. If only one person has it, correlate player names then mentally convert it to "invert first" or "invert last".
- **[Dominion]**:
    - <span class="important">If you're D2, you must also watch whether D1 gets the first AOE, so turn your camera to watch them.</span> If you get AOE and D1 also gets the AOE, you must adjust (and also if you don't get the AOE and D1 doesn't get the AOE either). *(This assumes you're using a common tower soak priority strategy.)*
    - <span class="important">If you weren't hit, START FOLLOWING YOUR CRACK IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT DELAY.</span>
