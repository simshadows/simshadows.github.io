This is a copy of the original LaTeX version as it was before migrating to web, along with a compiled PDF. The `.tex` file also comes with a package file containing all sorts of macros, but I decided not to copy it over here. This isn't intended to be compiled anymore anyway. I'm just keeping this here for archival purposes.

If you want to compile it, the original repository is <https://github.com/simshadows/monster-hunter-build-search/tree/master/monster-hunter-world/docs/status_damage_model>.
