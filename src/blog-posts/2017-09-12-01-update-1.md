So I've been thinking a bit more lately on how I want to structure my blog. So far, I've been doing far too much long-format almost-stream-of-consciousness writing (with minor editing to rearrange paragraphs) that's just really difficult to read. Although, as much as I'd like to write a tonne and be precise about everything, perhaps there's a better way?

Finding and establishing an effective blogging format is also of particular interest since I'm interested in using this as a public learning diary, yet I don't want to spend too much time writing. I just want to get down andÂ *do*.

So for a while, I guess my blogging style will shift around while I look for a sweet spot.

And on top of that, I'm also looking into figuring out how the categories should work and how I might organize the whole blog (and the other blogs) to make it easier for people to browse through, especially newcomers.
