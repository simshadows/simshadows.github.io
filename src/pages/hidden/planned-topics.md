## Programming

- More data structures and algorithms topics
    - Fundamentals and General Topics
        - Complexity, Big O, and Other Performance Topics
            - Also talk about complexity classes, NP completeness, and P=NP.
        - Binary Representation and Arithmetic
            - Bit shifting
            - IEEE 754 floating point, including special values, and cover quantization error and other important implications
            - overcoming overflow/underflow
            - ASCII, Unicode, and possibly other character encodings
            - Modular arithmetic (especially useful for competitive programming)
        - Dynamic Arrays
        - Array Search, Selection, and Partitioning Algorithms
            - Include Quickselect
        - Sorting Algorithms
        - Linked Lists
        - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
        - Tries
        - Hash Tables
    - Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms
        - Introduction
            - What is it?
            - What is the master theorem?
        - Karatsuba Multiplication
        - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    - Randomized Algorithms
    - Mathematical Computing
        - TODO: There should be a better name for this chapter since the scope is a little wider than the name suggests. Some of this stuff should maybe be moved to the intro chapter though.
        - How to compute square root? Linear search vs. binary search vs. Newtonâ€™s method? What about fast inverse square root?
        - Machine epsilon
        - How to manage overflow and underflow?
    - Appendices
        - Introduction to Fourier Analysis, for Computer Science Students
