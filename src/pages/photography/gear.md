### Sony FE 50mm F1.8

This is my second lens (after the 28-60mm f/4-5.6). It's definitely a great educational lens that gives you a very desirable normal focal length along with 

## Wishlist

Bodies:

- A second Sony full-frame body.
    - I want it to serve as a backup.
        - I don't want to be in a situation where I don't have a working camera. I'm a bit addicted lol
    - I want it for when I want to carry two cameras so I don't have to swap lenses.
        - I love shooting wide with my 16-35mm as my walkaround lens.
        - But sometimes, I stop for food and I often prefer 50mm for that. A second body in my bag with a compact 50mm lens would do great for this.
        - Lots of different ways to do this!
        - This setup also helps prevent dust accumulation.
    - Having a bit of variety in bodies can also be useful, e.g. maybe I use the a7cii normally, but if I expect good lighting conditions, I use the a7cr for the higher resolution.
        - I'd pick the a7cii for restaurants because the natural lighting is usually quite dim.
    - I'll probably wait for the next generation of bodies. But if I were to get one right now, it would probably be the a7cr.

Lenses:

- Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II (SEL70200GM2)
    - I don't have a need for a telephoto lens yet, so I haven't bought it. Maybe I'll get it if I have specific sports photography, wildlife, or portrait photography needs? Or something like that.

Lighting:

- I still don't know what I want for artificial lighting.
    - Portable flash for casual food photos within restaurants? But I'm not sure what's an appropriate way of approaching this that I can casually carry and also not annoy the other patrons.
    - Studio lighting for within my house. But I don't have enough space right now.
    - Portable flash for portraits, events, etc. but I'm not too sure what artistic effect I want with these yet.
    - Simple reflectors so I can do a little better for not that much more money.
    - But for now, natural lighting works well enough for me.

## Aspirational Wishlist

Everything in my wishlist above are items that I see myself ordering right now if I find myself needing to fill in a gap in my collection.

On the other hand, the items below are unlikely to be items I will buy in the near future:

Lenses:

- Sony FE 14mm F1.8 GM (SEL14F18GM)
- Sony FE 24mm F1.4 GM (SEL24F14GM)
