## PBO Limits

The PBO limits (PPT/TDC/EDC) are measured in mW or mA (as stated in the BIOS). They're absolute values, so to input 250W, you put in `250000`.

## Curve Optimizer

## Curve Shaper

There are 15 numbers you can set to shape the PBO curve:

<p>
<table class="general">
<tbody>
<tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Min Frequency</th>
    <th>Low Frequency</th>
    <th>Medium Frequency</th>
    <th>High Frequency</th>
    <th>Max Frequency</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Low Temp</th>
    <td>Low Temp<br/>Min Freq</td>
    <td>Low Temp<br/>Low Freq</td>
    <td>Low Temp<br/>Medium Freq</td>
    <td>Low Temp<br/>High Freq</td>
    <td>Low Temp<br/>Max Freq</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Medium Temp</th>
    <td>Medium Temp<br/>Min Freq</td>
    <td>Medium Temp<br/>Low Freq</td>
    <td>Medium Temp<br/>Medium Freq</td>
    <td>Medium Temp<br/>High Freq</td>
    <td>Medium Temp<br/>Max Freq</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>High Temp</th>
    <td>High Temp<br/>Min Freq</td>
    <td>High Temp<br/>Low Freq</td>
    <td>High Temp<br/>Medium Freq</td>
    <td>High Temp<br/>High Freq</td>
    <td>High Temp<br/>Max Freq</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>

For the purposes of my overclocking, I don't care about the temperature values. I only care about the frequencies.

For shorthand, I express the curve shaper configuration with 5 numbers:

- The first number is the number set to Min Freq Low Temp, Min Freq Medium Temp, and Min Freq High Temp.
- The second number is the number set to Low Freq Low Temp, Low Freq Medium Temp, and Low Freq High Temp.
- etc.

To achieve this in the BIOS,
