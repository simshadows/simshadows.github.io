# THIS PAGE IS A VERY EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

These notes on concurrency serve as a summary/refresher/reference. Some sections may be "pedagogically out of order" in order to make it more useful as a reference.

There's a lot of overlap between concurrency and operating systems internals, so basic concurrency is often taught within an operating systems course in undergraduate university. For this page, I aim to summarize the practical core concepts of concurrency while avoiding going into too much detail about operating systems internals. I will often assume that you already have background in Linux, systems-level programming, and operating systems internals.


## Synchronization Primitives

### Mutex

import MutexExample from "./_concurrency.code/mutex2.go?raw" //_

<Code code={MutexExample} lang="go" />

This will print: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.

If you remove the mutex, it prints: `1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3`.

<p><Todo>Hmm maybe rewrite it in C?</Todo></p>

### Semaphore

### Condition Variable

## Useful Concurrency Abstractions

### Thread/Process Pools

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>

### Monitors

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>

### Readers-Writer Lock

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>

### Channels (Golang)

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>

### Async/Await

Async/await isn't really a concurrency, though it gives the illusion of it.

<p><Todo>Actually, why isn't async/await considered concurrency? Maybe find some proper references on it.</Todo></p>


## Concurrency Bugs

### Deadlock

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>


## Implementations: Threads and Processes

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>


## Implementations: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>


## Lock-Free Data Structures

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>


## Non-Blocking Algorithms

<p><Todo>Start this!</Todo></p>


## Relevant Topics Not Covered

- Interrupts *(It's more of a systems internals topic.)*

<p><Todo>Anything else? It's a very short list...</Todo></p>


## References and Acknowledgements

I used someone's study list as a foundation for what to study. I'm not sure if they're comfortable with me calling them out, but you know who you are! Thanks for the study list!
