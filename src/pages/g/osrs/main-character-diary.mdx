## Goals Of This Character

My focus is on experiencing the game. Specifically:

- quests,
- exploring the map, seeing the places, talking to NPCs, enjoying the visual design, and
- trying out all sorts of different activities (including the interesting stuff you can do with the skills).

My approach to questing is to take suggestions on optimal quest order, but proceed with each quest *__unguided__*.

My approach to skill grind and moneymaking is to prefer the laziest methods possible.
