*I'm mainly interested in digital photography, so that will be the focus of my notes.*

*I've been dabbling with my current DSLR and phone photography for quite a while now and I enjoy the composition side of things, but I started this document mainly to fill a gap in knowledge around the technical side of photography, so that's what I'm focusing on fleshing out for now.*


## Section 1a: Core Technical Concepts

### Exposure Triangle

#### Shutter Speed

Slower shutter speed &#8594; more exposure, more motion blur.

#### Aperture

Smaller f-stop number &#8594; larger aperture &#8594; more exposure, shallower depth of field.

Mathematically, the f-stop (<Eq code="N" />) is a dimensionless ratio:

<DisplayLatex code="
    N
    = \frac{f}{D}
    = \frac{\text{focal length}}{\text{diameter of entrance pupil (effective aperture)}}
" />


#### ISO

Higher ISO number &#8594; more exposure, and *usually* more noise.

### Lenses

#### Focal Length

## Section 1c: Gear Considerations

### Single vs. Dual Card Slots

- Dual card slots running mirrored lowers the impact of single-card failures.
- *Lots of people on the internet say you should never do professional photography without dual card slots.*


## Section 2: Post-Production

TODO


## Section 3: Framing and Composition

*Although this section is put after all the technical stuff, this may be the most important thing in photography. I placed this section here to let the technical stuff give the framing and composition techniques context.*
