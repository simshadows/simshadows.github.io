## Rebase

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

More complex example:
```bash
git rebase --onto origin/master foo bar
```
*"Take the **bar** branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the **foo** branch, and replay those patches in the **bar** branch as if it was based directly off the **origin/master** branch instead."*

## Squash the last *N* commits

To squash the last 3 commits:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

In the following screen, leave the top commit as `pick`, and set all of the remaining as `squash`.
