## Rebase

```
git rebase master
```

More complex example:
```
git rebase --onto master foo bar
```
*"Take the **bar** branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the **foo** branch, and replay those patches in the **bar** branch as if it was based directly off the **master** branch instead."*
