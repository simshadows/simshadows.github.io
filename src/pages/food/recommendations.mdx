*Very early work-in-progress page! I'll be using this page to collect my thoughts on food places I recommend! I'm still exploring food places and figuring out what criteria I would use to add a food place to my list.*

## Sydney, Australia

- <Ve n="Gumshara" c="Japanese; Ramen" l="CBD, Haymarket"/> (2024-05-12)
    - They specialize in a unique style of thick tonkotsu ramen.
    - Gumshara is a bit polarizing. I absolutely love it, but some people think it's gimmicky and hate it. Regardless, I reckon they're worth trying at least once!
    - They don't do bookings. Expect very long lines.
    - They waive the huge card surcharge and weekend surcharge if you pay with physical cash.
- <Ve n="Umami Dojo" c="Japanese; Ramen" l="Pyrmont"/> (2024-08-03)
    - Great food in a quaint and intimate hole-in-the-wall setting.
    - They made the best karaage chicken I've ever had. So tender, juicy, and covered in a crispy breading.
    - You should book for this place. It's a very small shop, so you may show up only to see a sign saying no walk-ins for the day.

## Melbourne, Australia

I don't live in Melbourne so this is a list of places I particularly liked when I visited:

- <Ve n="Aroma Restaurant" c="Pakistani" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Juicy Bao" c="Chinese; Xiaolongbao; Dumplings" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Kumo Desserts" c="Desserts; Soufflé Pancakes" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Lulu's Char Koay Teow" c="Malaysian" l="CBD"/>
    - There are a lot of great places in Melbourne, but the Char Koay Teow from Lulu's is my favourite dish in Melbourne. So moreish.
- <Ve n="Pidapipó" c="Gelato" l="CBD"/>
    - Very popular gelato place with interesting flavours.
- <Ve n="Stalactites" c="Greek" l="CBD"/>
- <Ve n="Universal Restaurant" c="Italian" l="Carlton"/>

The food at Melbourne Airport (Tullamarine) isn't particularly notable, but if you really want something there, I recommend:

- <Ve n="Biggie Smalls" c="Western" l="Melbourne Airport, Tullamarine"/>
    - It's a fairly generic burger place and overpriced, but the quality and vibes are great.
    - Not recommended if you're cost-conscious. It's VERY expensive, but not noteworthy enough to be worth going over-budget for.
    - At the time of writing, this place is only accessible from both domestic terminals (airside). The loudspeaker announcements are only for the Virgin terminal though, so keep that in mind so you don't accidentally miss your flight.
