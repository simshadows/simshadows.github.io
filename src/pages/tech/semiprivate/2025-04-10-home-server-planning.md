## Uses

- Torrents
- Network storage
    - Keep a local copy of google drive (and possibly other cloud storage services)
- Managing a FLAC music library. Maybe I can listen to it via. a web app? A mobile app?
- Automatically pulls my git repos to back them up
- Automatically backs everything up to Backblaze?
- Host a Discord bot
- Smart home stuff?
- Home security stuff?

## Alternatives

- Web UI Torrent clients
    - rtorrent / rutorrent
        - I used this for years a long while back.
        - But this seems poorly maintained these days.
    - qBittorrent / VueTorrent
    - Deluge
