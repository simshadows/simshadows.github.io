<h1>Sim's Programming Learner's Checklist</h1>

<p><em>Currently an early work in progress. Started because I realized I was talking a lot about this sort of thing, may as well see how I do with attempting to compile a proper list. <b>This list sucks right now, and honestly, it's a lot harder to write than I thought, but I'm gonna keep trying to figure it out!</b></em></p>

<p><em>In my opinion, everything here is mandatory to deeply learn except anything with an asterisk. Asterisks indicate topics I feel you can get away with avoiding, though you should still do some light reading to at least have some idea on these topics.</em></p>


<h2>Programming Fundamentals</h2>

<p>
    <em>Side-note: This section assumes your first programming language is an imperative language. If you don't know what I mean by that, then you are almost certainly using an imperative language. You will likely be told by your instructor/book if your language is a functional language.</em>
    <ul>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Statically Typed Programming Fundamentals</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>COREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>C Language Fundamentals</h2>

<p>
    Chances are, the language you started with has made things very convenient for you. I think that every serious programmer should eventually try learning how to use C because C doesn't hold your hand (nearly as much). C will give you so much appreciation for all the bells and whistles other languages give you and give you a more critical understanding of algorithm and data structure performance.
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, C is a great stepping stone into learning C++, gives you great background for assembly language and digital circuit design (trust me, it will make sense when you get there), and practically necessary to learn about Operating Systems, other low-level/systems programming work, and deep security topics.
</p>
<p>
    I very much highly recommend learning C as your first language if you can, though <u>it's understandably not for everyone because it's a very tedious language to work with</u>. If you don't like it, there's no harm in holding it off for later when you're more motivated.
    <ul>
        <li>COREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals; Statically Typed Programming Fundamentals <em>(Corequisite means you need to learn these as well, but they can be learned together.)</em></li>
        <li>Know the concept of <em>memory safety</em>.</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Terminals, Git, Regex, and other incredibly useful miscellaneous topics</h2>

<p>
    Chances are, you've already had to learn a bit about how to use the terminal.
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Bare-Minimum Mathematics</h2>

<p>
    No, you technically don't need all that advanced university calculus and algebra, but there is some very unavoidable mathematics that you do need to be a great programmer.
    <ul>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals; Bare-Minimum Mathematics</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Web Development, Databases, and Web Security</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Programming Fundamentals; Networking</li>
        <li>RECOMMENDED PREREQUISITES: Terminals, Git, Regex, and other incredibly useful miscellaneous topics</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Assembly Language and Operating Systems</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: C Language Fundamentals; Data Structures and Algorithms; Terminals, Git, Regex, and other incredibly useful miscellaneous topics</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Pure Functional Programming Fundamentals</h2>

<p>
    Not gonna lie, I haven't breached this topic myself, but I expect it to be great for expanding your understanding (and breaking down your assumptions) of what programming languages can look like and do. You can get away with never trying pure functional for your whole career, but it may be worth it anyway. <b>Considering that this is a topic I'm unfamiliar with, take my comments on this with a grain of salt.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Further Mathematics</h2>

<p>
    Going above and beyond with math is a great asset for a programmer, giving you practice in thinking abstractly, and giving you a foundation in modelling all sorts of phenomena. On top of that, some things really do require the advanced stuff, namely calculus and linear algebra for computer graphics work and machine learning.
    <ul>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Cloud, Containers, and Container Orchestration</h2>

<p>
    Highly recommended to look into this if you're interested in web development.
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Web Development, Databases, and Web Security</li>
        <li>RECOMMENDED PREREQUISITES: Terminals, Git, Regex, and other incredibly useful miscellaneous topics</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Compilers and Interpreters</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Machine Learning</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] C++</h2>

<p>
    C++ deserves its own section because it's its own beast that's very different to most popular imperative languages. While you can get away with neglecting a lot of things, ignoring the subtleties will eventually be very painful. It is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot here.
</p>
<p>
    While I don't consider C to be a strict prerequisite, I very highly recommend learning C and doing a wide range of data structures and algorithms exercises in C before starting C++. Doing all sorts of <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">HackerRank</a> exercises and such is amazing for drilling in the most critical concepts in C++. But if you don't want to go the C route, you can still learn everything you need starting with C++ (and that knowledge should actually carry to C if you ever need to do C).
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>COREQUISITES: Statically Typed Programming Fundamentals; Object Oriented Programming</li>
        <li>RECOMMENDED PREREQUISITES: C Language Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Know everything from the <b>C Language Fundamentals</b> section, within the context of C++. (C++ is mostly a massive superset of C, and everything about C is extremely useful background for C++.)</li>
        <li>Know everything from the <b>Statically Typed Programming Fundamentals</b> section, within the context of C++. (C++ is a statically typed language with a very complicated type system.)</li>
        <li>Know everything from the <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> section, within the context of C++. (C++ is also an object oriented language, and it's quite important here.)</li>
        <li>Know <em>pointers</em> and <em>references</em>, and the differences between them.</li>
        <li>Know <em>lvalue/rvalue</em>, <em>copy/move semantics</em>, specifically <em>copy/move constructors</em>. Know how all these concepts relate to each other and the differences between them.
            <ul>
                <li>Know how <em>overload resolution</em> works here. For example, [TODO: I need to brush up on my C++ to come up with the proper wording for this lol]</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Know <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> and <tt>std::shared_ptr</tt>, how they improve memory safety, and how it relates to <em>lvalue/rvalue</em> and <em>copy/move semantics</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>More Advanced Topics</h2>

<p>
    There's so much out there that I can go on and on and on about what to look into.
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Further Mathematics; Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Computer Graphics, Physics, and Game Development</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>PREREQUISITES: Further Mathematics; Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>[OPTIONAL] Digital Circuits, Computer Architecture, and Custom Hardware Acceleration</h2>

<p>
    <em>I'm actually not entirely sure how to approach listing out for these topics. It probably may as well be its own big checklist, including topics on electrical circuit analysis and transistors. Feels too big to treat it as simply another section of this programmer's checklist.</em>
