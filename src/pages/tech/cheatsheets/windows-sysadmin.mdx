## Package Management with Chocolatey

Install Chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).

```ps
# Install `firefox`
choco install firefox

# Update all packages
choco upgrade all

# List all installed packages
choco list
```

## Network Auditing

```bash
ipconfig
route PRINT
tracert 8.8.8.8
```

- How to read a route table:
    - Netmask `0.0.0.0` is least-specificity. `255.255.255.255` is highest specificity.
    - Lower metric is higher priority.

(TODO: There's probably a better way to phrase this. "Specificity" isn't a very techically correct term, but it makes sense in my head.)
