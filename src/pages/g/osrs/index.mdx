**Unless otherwise noted, everything here is geared towards my preference for playing, which is:**

- **PAY-TO-PLAY,**
- **a very casual approach where my primary goal is to just _experience_ the game,**
- **I do all quests blind and without the *Quest Helper* plugin (but I take suggestions on the order in which to do them), and**
- **I prefer AFK-friendly grinding strategies (even if they might be slower).**

This page may not be regularly updated, so information here may be out-of-date.

## Running OSRS on Arch Linux

Install these packages:

- [Bolt Launcher (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bolt-launcher)
- [RuneLite (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/runelite)

Use Bolt Launcher to log into your Jagex account, then launch RuneLite from the Bolt Launcher UI.

Audio didn't work for me until I installed [pulseaudio-alsa](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pulseaudio-alsa/).

### Disabling quest help

Make sure you turn off the *Puzzle Solver* plugin. That's turned on by default for some reason.
